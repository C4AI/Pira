B2582,"The starting point is the four main ocean basins of our planet: the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Even though they have different names, they form one single interconnected ocean system. The basins have been created over geological times by the movement of the tectonic plates across the Earth’s mantle. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles to the continental slopes leading down to the continental rises and the abyssal plains. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift-valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine, when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) have created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins, there are marginal seas, more or less separated from the main ocean basins by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges and formed by various processes. The water of the ocean mixes and circulates within those geological structures. Although the proportion of the different chemical components dissolved in seawater is essentially constant over time, that water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the seawater. Salinity varies according to the relative balance between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Differences in salinity and temperature of water masses can cause seawater to be stratified into separate layers. Such stratification can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients, with an obvious variety of consequences in both cases for the biotas sensitive to those factors. A further variation is in the penetration of light, which controls where the photosynthesis on which nearly all ocean life depends can take place. Below a few tens of metres at the coastal level or a few hundred meters in the clearer open ocean, the ocean becomes dark and there is no photosynthesis. Superimposed on all this is a change in the acidity of the ocean. The ocean absorbs annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. That gas reacts with the seawater to form carbonic acid, which is making the ocean more acid.
 ","How can stratification affect the composition of seawater?
 ","Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean.
 ","The ocean absorbs annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
 ","It can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients.
 ","Because they help to release oxygen back into the atmosphere by a high level of primary production from photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the zone of light penetration
 ","It may result in an increased deposit of harmful materials and excess nutrients into the ocean, increased levels of sewage discharge and plastic materials, resulting in the creation of large quantities of marine debris and negative impacts to marine life, ocean aesthetic, and socioeconomic effects.

A832,"Brazilian carbonate reservoirs contain huge oil-in-place volumes and are likely to have an important economic impact in global oil industry. Such carbonate reservoirs, both Albian and Aptian, are located offshore in deep water, which has an important role in development costs. In siliciclastic plays it is standard practice to use time-lapse (4D) seismic to locate wells in unswept areas, maximizing the recovery factor. However, in carbonate plays, time-lapse seismic monitoring remains challenging, with few cases of success published around the world. Carbonates differ from siliciclastic rocks in many aspects. With a varied chemical composition and complex pore connectivity, carbonates bring on a large diversity of facies, each one showing a specific seismic response. Moreover, the usually high incompressibility of the carbonate matrix reduces sensitivity to pressure and saturation changes, which are the main effects expected on a hydrocarbon field undergoing production. Considering both the economic relevance and the difficulties of using time-lapse seismic to monitor carbonate reservoirs, Petrobras created a strategic program to face this challenge, a time-lapse seismic (S4D) study of an Albian carbonate reservoir located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Three legacy data were available: streamer-1987, streamer-2002, and ocean-bottom cable-2010. Extensive feasibility studies are performed as well as a meticulous prestack 4D simultaneous inversion based on the seismic data, preliminary cross-equalized to partially overcome the initial low repeatability. A multidisciplinary interpretation conducted by a team of geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers finally lead to results overcoming expectations. Saturation and pressure changes are detected using P-and S-impedance attributes, consistent with production data. Results are opening perspectives for further monitoring other carbonate reservoirs, especially with new presalt Brazilian discoveries in the Campos and Santos Basins, which might have a huge economic impact.
 ","Why is it hard to succeed on using time-lapse (4D) seismic to locate wells in unswept areas in carbonate plays?

A360,"This work presents a column generation baaed heuristic algorithm for the problem of planning the flights of helicopters to attend transport requests among airports in the continent and offshore platforms on the Campos basin for the Brazilian State Oil Company (Petrobras). We start from a previous MIP based heuristic for this Helicopter Routing Problem and add column generation procedures that improve the solution quality. This is done by extending the earlier formulation and providing an algorithm to find optimal passenger allocation to fixed helicopter routes. A post optimization procedure completes the resulting algorithm, which is more stable and allows consistently finding solutions that improve the safety and the cost of the one done by the oil company experts.

A1714,"Pollen and spore palynomorph diversity on Rio Grande do Sul inner continental shelf, southern Brazil. The knowledge of modern pollen and spore morphology are very important to consistent palynomorph identifications and robust interpretations on past vegetation and climate change. The objective of this work was to describe pollen and spore palynomorph assemblage over Rio Grande do Sul inner continental shelf, to facilitate and improve palynomorph descriptions and interpretations. The Rio Grande do Sul coastal area is NE/SW oriented, extends for over 600 km, and has two inlets, Patos and Tramandaí lagoons. The water masses that influence this region are Subantarctic Shelf Water, Tropical Water and south Atlantic Central Water, beyond two freshwater sources, from Rio de la Plata estuary and Patos lagoon. The wind circulation there is strongly seasonal, predominantly NE during summer and SW during winter. The surface sediments were sampled in two sites: (i) 48 samples from Balneário Hermenegildo (REMPLAC Project) and (ii) 5 samples from ‘Amazônia Azul’ Project, at Patos lagoon inlet area. We have identified the following families: one family of Bryophyta: Anthocerothaceae; eight families of Pteridophyta: Blechnaceae, Cyatheaceae, Equisetaceae, Lycopodiaceae, Ophioglossaceae, Osmundaceae, Pteridaceae and Polypodiaceae; three families of Monocotyledons: Arecaceae, Cyperaceae and Poaceae; and seven families of Eudicotyledons: Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Betulaceae, Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Typhaceae and Verbenaceae.

A1451,"This work reports on the widespread occurrence of tar balls on a pebble beach of Sueste Bay on Fernando de Noronha Island, a Brazilian national marine park and a preserve in the South Equatorial Atlantic. Environmental regulations preclude regular visitors to the Sueste Bay beach, and the bay is a pristine area without any possible or potential sources of petroleum in the coastal zone. In this work, these tar balls were observed for the first time as they occurred as envelopes around beach pebbles. They are black in color, very hard, have a shell and coral fragment armor, and range in average size from 2 to 6 cm. The shape of the majority of the tar balls is spherical, but some can also be flattened ellipsoids. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon analyses of the collected samples revealed the characteristics of a strongly weathered material, where only the most persistent compounds were detected: chrysene, benzo(b,k)fluoranthene, dibenzo(a,h)antracene and benzo(a)pyrene.

A1243,"The energy sector has been global before globalization became a household word. At least since 1901, major oil and gas companies have ventured abroad searching for commercially viable resources that are open to development. In 2011, the investment flows traceable to coal, oil, and natural gas investments alone represented $105 billion of FDI. That does not count the trade and investment activity that follows in their wake, supplying goods and services to the E & P firms. Globalization has changed the sector, however. In recent years, national oil companies - always a feature of the landscape - have increasingly taken a major role in projects in their own countries and sometimes even overseas. Statoil of Norway, Petrobras of Brazil, Sonangol of Angola, China National Petroleum Company (CNPC), the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA), and others throughout the developed and developing world, many espousing strong resource nationalism policies, have made their policy voices heard. Their ability to control the resources in their own jurisdiction, to dictate the terms of concessions and production sharing contracts, to mandate increasing local benefits (indigenization) and government 'take,' have significant implications for the terms of transactions and the financial benefits flowing from these projects. The discovery of deepwater offshore deposits (for example, off the west coast of Africa, and the 'pre-salt' deposits in Brazil), have required more capital and know-how to effectively access and develop those resources.

B2413,"Invasion by non-indigenous species (NIS) is a major driver of biodiversity change that can reduce biodiversity, alter community structure and function, diminish fisheries and aquaculture production and impact human health and well-being. It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems. NIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).
 ","What is the definition of non-indigenous species provided?
 ","Non-indigenous species are those that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier and become established in a biogeographical area outside their native range.
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio). In addition, there is some evidence related to the increase of some harmful algal species related to climate warming in some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016).

A1085,"In 2004, after a cycle of 11 yr in which the annual increase in crude oil production was 8.6% avg, the production decreased 3%, according to Petrobras. In 2003, the production was 1.54 million bpd avg. The decline in production was due to delays in construction and the arrival of two Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels, the P-43 and P-48. The P-43 began to process crude oil on 12/22/2004. When the P-48 enters service, Petrobras will be able to increase its production of crude oil by 500,000 bpd. The P-43 is stationed in the Barracuda field, bay of Campos, offshore the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 800 m of water. Initial oil yield is 10,380 bpd of 25° gravity. Platform P-48, the twin of P-43, is part of the Barracuda-Caratinga project that will increase Petrobras crude oil production by 300,000 bpd. This platform will enter service in January 2005. With the new capacity, the production of crude oil by Petrobras is expected to reach 1.9 million bpd by the end of 2005. Other floating installations will contribute as well when they enter service, the P-50 and P-34. Petrobras is to invest $26,200 million until 2010 for E&P. Between 2005 and 2008, 17 installations will enter service allowing annual increases of 5.9% in production of crude oil and NGL, achieving self sufficiency in 2006. Petrobras has invested heavily in improved recovery that in the last 10 yr in the Marlim oilfield has yielded an additional increment of 3000 million bbl of crude oil. In November 2004 Petrobras gave a $47 million contract to the Western Geco company to make a three dimensional seismic study of the Marlim basin to identify reserves there. Discovery of an additional 290 million bbl of crude oil in Marlim is expected. On dry land, improved recovery enabled an increment of 200,000 bpd in production from the fields in the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe in 2004. In 2006-2007, the company expects to substitute for imports of light crude oil its own production to start in the oilfield offshore the state of Espírito Santo. This is lighter crude oil than that from the bay of Campos where the company now obtains 80% of its oil production. The Brazilian oilfields produce mainly heavy crude oil that has to be mixed with lighter imported crude oil to produce quality gasoline. However, Brazil increases its exports of heavy crude oil. The company is involved in new areas of exploration. They are discussed. The Brazilian Petroleum Authority, Agencia Nacional de Petroleo, will likely hold the 7th hydrocarbon licensing round for concessions in crude oil E&P in October 2005.

B2405,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Levels of by-catch (non-target fish, marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds), discards and waste Current estimates of the number of overfished stocks do not take into account the broader effects of fishing on marine ecosystems and their productivity. In the past, large numbers of dolphins drowned in fishing nets. This mortality greatly reduced the abundance of several dolphin species in the latter half of the twentieth century. Thanks to international efforts, fishing methods have changed and the by-catch has been reduced significantly. Commercial fisheries are the most serious pressure at sea that the world’s seabirds face, although there is evidence of some reductions of by-catch in some key fisheries. Each year, incidental by-catch in longline fisheries is estimated to kill at least 160,000 albatrosses and petrels, mainly in the southern hemisphere. For marine reptiles, a threat assessment scored fishery by-catch as the highest threat across marine turtle subpopulations, followed by harvesting (that is, for human consumption) and coastal development. The mitigation of those causes of mortality can be effective, even though the lack of reliable data can hamper the targeting of mitigation measures. Depending on the particular species and fishery methods, mitigation may include the use of acoustic deterrents, gear modifications, time or area closures and gear switching (for example, from gillnets to hooks and lines). In particular, the global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing called for by the General Assembly in 1991 was a major step in limiting the by-catch of several marine mammal and seabird species that were especially vulnerable to entanglement.

B2443,"Theme E Increased use of ocean space, especially in coastal areas, create conflicting demands for dedicated marine space. This arises both from the expansion of long-standing uses of the ocean (such as fishing and shipping) and from newly developing uses (such as hydrocarbon extraction, mining and the generation of renewable energy conducted offshore). In most cases, those various activities are increasing without any clear overarching management system or a thorough evaluation of their cumulative impacts on the ocean environment, thus increasing the potential for conflicting and cumulative pressures. Theme F The current, and growing, levels of population and industrial and agricultural production result in increasing inputs of harmful material and excess nutrients into the ocean. Growing concentrations of population can impose, and in many areas are imposing, levels of sewage discharge that are beyond the local carrying capacity and which cause harm to human health. Even if discharges of industrial effluents and emissions were restrained to the lowest levels in proportion to production that are currently practicable, continuing growth in production would result in increased inputs to the ocean. The growing use of plastics that degrade very slowly result in increased quantities reaching the ocean and have many adverse effects, including the creation of large quantities of marine debris in the ocean, and negative impacts on marine life and on the aesthetic aspects of many ocean areas, and thus consequent socioeconomic effects.

A1541,"Volcanic oceanic islands host soils that may hold important paleo-environmental proxies, based on vegetation and faunal evidences coupled with pedological and geomorphological indicators. In this regard, the main Brazilian oceanic island of Fernando de Noronha (FNI) still lacks a deeper and more complete analysis of its climatic history and soil evolution. We select and collect representative FNI soils to interpret their chemical, physical and mineralogical properties and to explain their changing pedogenesis and geomorphic balance, aiming at revealing the environmental and landscape evolutionary history of this island. Ten soil pedons on phonolites, ankaratrites and the associated pyroclastic rocks were collected in June/2018. Six profiles were classified as Inceptisols, one as Entisol, one as Mollisol, one as Vertisol and another as the first Oxisol ever described in a Brazilian oceanic island. The pH ranged between 5.0 and 6.0 in the more developed, dystrophic and Al-saturated soils, whereas alkaline pHs were found in the eutrophic and Na-rich pedons. For the latter group, chemical and physical attributes are closely associated with the parent material composition, whereas in the former, present day soil features overprint paleoweathered regoliths and former pedogenetic processes. High concentrations of available phosphorus (P) were observed in all soils and horizons, even at depths greater than 150 cm, and P forms were detected as amorphous or poorly-crystalline phosphates (Al, Fe, Na, Ca and K). High- and low-activity clay minerals coexist, combined with gibbsite and unstable primary minerals, indicating the polygenetic nature of FNI soils. A combined pedogeomorphological analysis indicated the existence of a high paleoweathered plateau with relict soils, and erosional surfaces hosting younger soils. Results showed the succession of at least three distinct main paleoclimates since the Pliocene and a post-magmatic model for landscape evolution. The unreported, widespread and intense phosphatization of all soils and paleosurfaces is attributed to a past large population of birds nesting all over the island, corroborating old historical records of the island's early occupation.

The use of tension leg platforms, spars and floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) systems are key to such expansion. In the next decade, frontier regions such as the eastern Mediterranean, the east coast of South America (Brazil and Guyana), and the west coast of Africa could be the major growth drivers for offshore oil and gas exploration and production. There is an upward trend in decommissioning activity, in particular in mature regions, such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration and production practices continue to evolve to minimize potential impacts on the surrounding environment. The creation of regulatory capacity to manage offshore resources effectively, especially in frontier regions, requires significant commitment and long-term institutional investment.

A1554,"Although significantly impacted, Guanabara Bay (GB), located in southeastern Brazil, is still an important fishery source for the state of Rio de Janeiro. Hg contamination, in particular, is of concern in the area and should be regularly monitored, as Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes may lead public health risks to the local human population due to the consumption of contaminated food items, such as crabs. In this context, the aim of the present study was to determine total Hg (THg) concentrations in swimming crabs from three GB areas and investigate the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on Hg concentrations at the beginning and the end of the rainy season. Crabs and water samples were obtained from three areas, inside the bay, at the mouth of the bay and outside the bay. A clear rainfall effect on the investigated abiotic variables was observed, with increased rainfall and temperatures noted at the end of the study period. Significant statistical correlations were observed between THg concentrations and the assessed abiotic variables at the three study points at the beginning and end of the rainy season. The rainy season was noted as directly affecting THg concentrations at Guanabara Bay and, consequently, swimming crab THg contents. THg concentrations in swimming crabs at Urca and at the Cagarras Islands were higher at the beginning of the rainy season compared to the end, while the opposite was observed for the sampling point outside the bay. Higher Hg concentrations were detected at the outermost point of the bay in relation to the Cagarras Islands, probably due to the local upwelling event. THg values in Callinectes sp. were higher than concentrations reported for other areas in Brazil but lower than other reports worldwide. Calculated THg intakes surpassed the maximum National Research Council permissible limits of 0.049 mg/week at all sampling stations during both seasons, raising public health concerns. Further research for longer monitoring periods during different seasons are essential to ascertain which climatic period is most critical regarding Hg availability at this anthropogenically-impacted estuary.

B2581,"The starting point is the four main ocean basins of our planet: the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Even though they have different names, they form one single interconnected ocean system. The basins have been created over geological times by the movement of the tectonic plates across the Earth’s mantle. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles to the continental slopes leading down to the continental rises and the abyssal plains. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift-valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine, when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) have created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins, there are marginal seas, more or less separated from the main ocean basins by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges and formed by various processes. The water of the ocean mixes and circulates within those geological structures. Although the proportion of the different chemical components dissolved in seawater is essentially constant over time, that water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the seawater. Salinity varies according to the relative balance between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Differences in salinity and temperature of water masses can cause seawater to be stratified into separate layers. Such stratification can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients, with an obvious variety of consequences in both cases for the biotas sensitive to those factors. A further variation is in the penetration of light, which controls where the photosynthesis on which nearly all ocean life depends can take place. Below a few tens of metres at the coastal level or a few hundred meters in the clearer open ocean, the ocean becomes dark and there is no photosynthesis. Superimposed on all this is a change in the acidity of the ocean. The ocean absorbs annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. That gas reacts with the seawater to form carbonic acid, which is making the ocean more acid.
 ","How much carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean from human emissions?
 ","Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean.
 ","The ocean absorbs annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
 ","It can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients.

A1444,"When performing classic uncertainty reduction according to dynamic data, a large number of reservoir simulations need to be evaluated at high computational cost. As an alternative, we construct Bayesian emulators that mimic the dominant behavior of the reservoir simulator, and which are several orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. We combine these emulators within an iterative procedure that involves substantial but appropriate dimensional reduction of the output space (which represents the reservoir physical behavior, such as production data), enabling a more effective and efficient uncertainty reduction on the input space (representing uncertain reservoir parameters) than traditional methods, and with a more comprehensive understanding of the associated uncertainties. This study uses the emulation-based Bayesian history-matching (BHM) uncertainty analysis for the uncertainty reduction of complex models, which is designed to address problems with a high number of both input and output parameters. We detail how to efficiently choose sets of outputs that are suitable for emulation and that are highly informative to reduce the input-parameter space and investigate different classes of outputs and objective functions. We use output emulators and implausibility analysis iteratively to perform uncertainty reduction in the input-parameter space, and we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of certain popular classes of objective functions in this context. We demonstrate our approach through an application to a benchmark synthetic model (built using public data from a Brazilian offshore field) in an early stage of development using 4 years of historical data and four producers. This study investigates traditional simulation outputs (e.g., production data) and also novel classes of outputs, such as misfit indices and summaries of outputs. We show that despite there being a large number (2,136) of possible outputs, only very few (16) were sufficient to represent the available information; these informative outputs were used using fast and efficient emulators at each iteration (or wave) of the history match to perform the uncertainty-reduction procedure successfully. Using this small set of outputs, we were able to substantially reduce the input space by removing 99.8% of the original volume. We found that a small set of physically meaningful individual production outputs were the most informative at early waves, which once emulated, resulted in the highest uncertainty reduction in the input-parameter space, while more complex but popular objective functions that combine several outputs were only modestly useful at later waves. The latter point is because objective functions such as misfit indices have complex surfaces that can lead to low-quality emulators and hence result in noninformative outputs. We present an iterative emulator-based Bayesian uncertainty-reduction process in which all possible input-parameter configurations that lead to statistically acceptable matches between the simulated and observed data are identified. This methodology presents four central characteristics: incorporation of a powerful dimension reduction on the output space, resulting in significantly increased efficiency; effective reduction of the input space; computational efficiency, and provision of a better understanding of the complex geometry of the input and output spaces.

B2382,"Changes in pressure Economics and population growth commonly drive human occupation of the coastal zone, which is offset by the socioeconomic costs of coastal management and adverse effects upon coastal ecosystem services. The balance between those pressures is commonly challenged by jurisdictional or economic divisions, with benefits and impacts often separated geographically (e.g., updrift accretion and downdrift erosion affect different communities) or occurring over different time scales (e.g., building a sea wall may defer the erosion pressure by a generation, but may effectively commit a community to subsequent construction of additional or larger works). Secular changes to erosion and sedimentation may exceed the tolerance of coastal systems to adjust. For natural systems, such changes can lead to a loss of ecosystem services (Xu and others, 2019). Human activities may be intolerant of coastal dynamics, such as infrastructure that may be damaged or lose function owing to changing shoreline or seabed position. The perceived need to respond to erosion or sedimentation generally depends on the nature of human activities in the coastal zone, as follows: Port facilities, including harbour basins and navigable access channels, typically extend across the bulk of the active coastal zone, and the retention of port functions frequently requires coastal sediment management using breakwaters and dredging (see also chap. 14); Substantial urban growth has occurred along the coasts since the 1950s, with the number of coastal cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants increasing from 472 in 1950 to 2,129 in 2012 (Barragán and Andrés, 2015; see also chap. 14); Coastal management responses vary substantially, depending upon economics, legislation and social values, and are broadly classified into strategies of protection, accommodation, managed retreat and sacrifice (Williams and others, 2018); Rural sensitivity to erosion and sedimentation is typically determined by the impacts to the drainage and flood mitigation structures (Hou and others, 2016); as they are commonly located in the supratidal zone, their sensitivity to coastal change is not always apparent.

B2090,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Impacts of disturbance from noise Anthropogenic noise in the ocean increased in the last half of the past century. Commercial shipping is the main source, and the noise that it produces is often in frequency bands used by many marine mammals for communication. Many other types of marine biotas have also been shown to be affected by anthropogenic noise. Other significant sources of noise are seismic exploration for the offshore hydrocarbon industry and sonar. The impact of noise can be both to disrupt communication among animals and to displace them from their preferred breeding, nursery or feeding grounds, with consequent potential effects on their breeding success and survival. Impacts of recreational fishing Recreational fishing is a popular activity in many industrialized countries, in which up to 10 per cent of the adult population may participate. The impact of that type of fishing is only sometimes taken into account in fishery management, although the quantities caught can be significant for the management of stocks experiencing overfishing. In several countries, there is a substantial industry supporting the recreational catching of sport fish (including trophy fish, such as marlins, swordfish and sailfish), but catch statistics are generally not available.

A759,"Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree. After being disassembled, the new subsea safety tree was inspected; the inspection showed minimal damage and erosion on the inside walls of the tool, indicating that the equipment would qualify for this type of offshore operation.

A1538,"CO2-WAG (Water-Alternating-Gas) has been applied in offshore Brazilian oilfields to improve recovery rates and mitigate the environmental impact that venting produced CO2 would bring. Although CO2 is highly miscible in oil under these reservoirs conditions, this gas is also extremely mobile, and its speciation in the aqueous phase drives reactions with carbonates that can cause severe inorganic scaling problems in production systems. It is crucial, therefore, to effectively design CO2-WAG operations for mobility control and, consequently, enhance reservoir performance, CO2 utilization and flow assurance. This paper addresses the design optimization of coupled CO2-EOR and storage operations applied to the Brazilian Pre-salt offshore context (reservoir properties, infrastructure, regulatory framework and economic characteristics), examining the trade-offs of project profitability, CO2 utilization and calcite scale risk. Several compositional simulations of miscible WAG scenarios were performed and key design parameters were optimized using statistical sampling and evolutionary algorithms. Aqueous and mineral reactions were included in the calculations, allowing us to quantify the calcite mass that can potentially deposit in the perforations and production system. The results showed how optimizing WAG operations can significantly improve the economics and the scale management of oil production from carbonate reservoirs. The optimal WAG design greatly increased incremental NPV per volume of CO2 stored and reduced calcite scale risk by simply rearranging the WAG slugs in a tapered manner. Here we demonstrate that this methodology can be used to determine how to recycle CO2 in a given field for better economics and lower carbon footprint, doing so without triggering calcite mineral deposition to the point of permanent jeopardy of production wells and facilities operability. Therefore, the workflow integrates critical challenges that are correlated, yet often addressed independently, supporting the complex decision-making of CO2-EOR operational design in carbonate reservoirs.

A1767,"Mapping of natural gas hydrate systems has been performed successfully in the past using the controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method. This method relies on differentiating resistive highly saturated free gas or hydrate bearing host sediment from a less resistive low-saturated gas or brine-bearing host sediments. Knowledge of the lateral extent and resistivity variations (and hence the saturation variations) within sediments that host hydrates is crucial to be able to accurately quantify the presence of saturated gas hydrates. A 3D CSEM survey (PUCRS14) was acquired in 2014 in the Pelotas Basin offshore Brazil, with hydrate resistivity mapping as the main objective. The survey was acquired within the context of the CONEGAS research project which investigated the origin and distribution of gas hydrate deposits in the Pelotas Basin. We inverted the acquired data using a proprietary 3D CSEM anisotropic inversion algorithm. Inversion was purely CSEM data-driven, and we did not include any a-priori information in the process. Prior to CSEM, interpretation of near-surface geophysical data including 2D seismic, sub-bottom profiler and multibeam bathymetry data indicated possible presence of gas hydrates within features identified such as faults, chimneys and seeps leading to pockmarks, along the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) and within the gas hydrate stability zone. Upon integration of the same with CSEM derived resistivity volume, the interpretation revealed excellent spatial correlation with many of these features. The interpretation further revealed new features with possible hydrate presence, which were previously overlooked due to a lack of a clear seismic and/or multibeam backscatter signature. Also, features which were previously mapped as gas hydrate bearing had to be reinterpreted as residual or low saturated gas/hydrate features, due to lack of significant resistivity response associated with them. We further used the inverted resistivity volume to derive saturation volume of the subsurface using Archie's equation.

Here we report a 14-month monitoring of benthic assemblages in a tropical estuary in the Eastern Brazil Marine Ecoregion during the severe drought period of 2015/2016. The drought in Eastern Brazil resulted in a decrease of estuarine mean sediment particle size and concurrent changes in macrofaunal benthic assemblages during the driest months. We also observed a 3-fold reduction on macrofaunal abundance with dominance of surface-dwelling Magelonid, Sternaspid, Capitellid and Oligochaeta annelids. The changes in macrofaunal structure during the severe drought also decreased the community bioturbation potential (BPc) by 5-fold, if compared to pre-drought periods. We argue that the projected increases in the frequency and severity of climatic events, such as observed during severe droughts worldwide, will greatly change the benthic fauna and their ecological functions in tropical estuarine ecosystems.

A1109,"Exploration for oil under the salt layer is concentrated in the basins of Santos, Campos, and Espiritu Santo, Brazil. Hopefully it extends to the eastern margin of the Jequitinhonha and Camamu-Almada basins. These basins have been unexplored under the salt layer with respect to the present objectives. One Petrobras estimate is that there may be thousands of millions bbl of reserves of light petroleum under the salt in the Campos basin. Because of the urgency to import light oil to mix with heavy crude oil that is the major part of Brazilian production in the old Petrobras refineries and as a result of the immense oil discoveries of Tertiary/Cretaceous in the 1970's and 1980's and the first half of the 1990's, Brazilian exploration concentrates mainly in the reserves of the Tertiary and Cretaceous Superior of the Campos basin. Exploration under the salt layer in Campos and other basins has been sporadic. It is difficult to calculate the cost of developing the fields under the salt layer in Brazil but the costs could exceed any borne to date. If the layer under the salt becomes an object of commercial exploration, the development of the fields could reach $2,000 to $4,000 million or more. In the last 5 yr heavy lacustrian petroleum and gas accumulations have been found in the reservoirs of Tertiary and Cretaceous Superior in the Campos basin. These are formed mainly by biodegradation. As a result of this, giant deposits of petroleum/gas are expected under the Tertiary Superior and the Cretaceous of Marlim, Albacora, Roncador, Barracuda, Jubarte, Cachalote, Golfinho, and the petroleum accumulation BSS-69 and elsewhere. A number of historic and current oil and gas production figures are given for various Petrobras fields. In the Espírito Santobasin the potential reserves of light oil are about 600 MM boe, most of which in deep waters. Petrobras produces light oil in 87 fields 12 of which are maritime (as of 2005). Brazil produces up to 1.76 MM bpd of petroleum of which about 70% is heavy oil. The average production of gas has been 43.9 MM cu m/day as of September 2006. Probable reserves in Brazil are 11.36 B bbl of oil and 297 B cu m of gas.
 ","What is the cost of exploring the layer under the salt in Brazil?

B2422,"Inputs and resources Land and water are the most important resources for aquaculture development. Gentry and others (2017) estimated that 11,400,000 km2 of coastline are suitable for fishes, and more than 1,500,000 km2 could be developed for bivalves. The challenge is to secure suitable land and water resources for the development of aquaculture at the national level. Good quality seeds and optimal feeds are essential. Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern. In 2016, about 55.6 million tons of farmed fishes (including Indian carps) and crustaceans depended on external feeds (composed of fresh ingredients, farm-made or commercially manufactured) (FAO, 2018b). In 2005, aquaculture consumed about 4.2 million tons of fishmeal (18.5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). By 2015, this had been reduced to 3.35 million tons (7 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014). The aquaculture sector should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.

A475,"Oil production in ultra-deep waters places some new challenges for floating units. As an FPSO is one of most common types of production units adopted by Petrobras, its behavior in extreme conditions has to be fully tested and verified. During extreme sea storms, ship type floating structures may be subjected to water on deck events (green water). In order to allow a detailed structural analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques may be used to investigate detailed loads due to water on deck propagation, especially in beam sea conditions, which are not traditionally covered by maritime rules. Based on model test results, water ingress and water on deck propagation are simulated through CFD analysis. The methodology adopted consists of two different approaches: (i) The influence of a riser balcony lateral extent is analyzed based on a 2D wave propagation model and; (ii) the complex flow behavior through topside equipment is discussed by using a 3D simulation of a restricted deck area, including some strategies for impact protection. The results of the simulations allow investigation of the complex flow behavior depending on the riser balcony extent and topside configuration, as well as the resulting loads on critical structures. For a side hull balcony, its protective effect against wave run-up in beam waves is only effective with a lateral extent of 8m. By performing water on deck simulations, the benefits of ""V"" type protections are quantified leading to 20% loading reduction when compared to flat plates. The simulations reveal CFD as a very powerful tool to assess detailed transient pressure distributions for optimized structural design.

B2557,"Changes in impact Coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation pose severe risks to coastal infrastructure, property, economic activities and ecological systems, and adaptation calls for significant investment. There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018). The projection for risk and damage associated with coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation indicates that they are likely to increase in the future (Dunn and others, 2019). Ecosystem impacts from coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation can be substantial, in particular if there is a transformation from long-term accretion to erosion. Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b). Major socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density. Existing problems have been identified adjacent to the Ganges, Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, Volta and Mississippi river deltas. For other parts of the coast, the management of erosion hazards through the use of engineering interventions requires longterm commitments to maintenance, including the cost of upgrading coastal defensive works, with potential risk to human safety and livelihoods if defences are subject to decline. Local sea level rise and storminess vary significantly between regions. Based on long-term satellite data, wave height shows an overall global increase (Young and Ribal, 2019), but large regional differences are reported, from large changes in the Southern Ocean to negligible effects in the North Sea (De Winter and others, 2012). Such spatial variations are likely to result in regional variations in erosion and sedimentation (Brown and others, 2016).
 ","Where are major socioeconomic impacts mostly likely to occur?
 ","With the increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified coastlines, there is a high risk of ecological disturbance to organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nursery purposes, which also reduces the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone.

A1607,"Meteorological data collected using ocean buoys are very important for weather forecasting. In addition, they provide valuable information on ocean–atmosphere interaction processes that have not yet been explored. Accordingly, data collection using ocean buoys is well established around the world. In Brazil, ocean buoy data are obtained by the Brazilian Navy through a monitoring network on the Brazilian coast, which has high potential for wind power generation. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze the scaling behavior of wind speed on the Brazilian coast (continental shelf), South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa in order to determine long-range correlations and acquire more information on the crossover phenomenon at various scales. For this purpose, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique and numerical simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model were used. The results from buoys show that wind speed exhibits a scaling behavior, but without the crossover phenomenon in the Brazilian coast, South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa, indicating the dependence of the phenomenon by the terrestrial surface, suggesting influence on the wind power generation. Buoy data from the South Atlantic Ocean and coast Africa showed a subdiffusive behavior (α ≥ 1), whereas those from the Brazilian coast indicated persistence (0.5 < α < 1), except for the confluence region of Porto Seguro, which indicated anti-persistence (α = 0.48). The numerical simulations using the WRF mesoscale model showed a subdiffusive behavior on the Brazilian coast, and no persistence was reproduced in most coastal buoys. The findings support deeper understanding of the wind regime and its associated properties, with particular attention to the Brazilian continental shelf, suggesting that the methodology is useful for assessing the potential of offshore wind power generation.

The entire fleet provides services to Petrobras through chartering contracts between shipping companies and Petrobras' operational sectors. In 2012 these vessels were involved in 95 recorded accidents that did not fall under the category of occupational accidents, such as crashes, collisions, chemical spills (including oil and oil denvates), floods, fires and strandings. Aiming to reduce the occurrence of these events, Petrobras has established a group, formed from the operational sectors of the Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE), to implant the concepts of safety within those shipping companies providing support services to Petrobras.

B2072,"There are a number of threats to human health arising from the marine environment that have now been identified: Increase in the spread of pathogens related to climate warming (e.g., Vibrio). Also, there is some evidence related to an increase in some harmful algal bloom species related to climate warming is some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016); Recently, non-indigenous species, sometimes called invasive alien species, have started to be considered as one of the major threats to global marine ecosystems through impacts on the ecosystems’ structure, function and services (Galil, 2018). A small number of poisonous or venomous marine non-indigenous species represent potential threats to human health. Intensification of anthropogenic activities, coupled with rapidly increasing coastal urbanization, drive complex and fundamental changes in coastal waters, including increases in alien species. Some of the alien venomous and poisonous species have attracted the attention of scientists, managers, the media and the public for their conspicuous human health impacts. In the Mediterranean alone, 10 non-indigenous species are considered human health hazards, running the gamut from nuisance to lethal (Galil, 2018). Human health hazards of non-indigenous species are expected to worsen as a result of climate change. The poleward influx of warm water biota enables them to spread to regions as yet uncolonized; A further, recently identified health threat is the potential role of plastic marine litter as a vector for opportunistic human pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Barboza and others, 2018; Harrison and others, 2018; Imran and others, 2019). Various pathogenic bacteria bind, in particular and strongly, to plastic litter (for example, Vibrio cholerae and some strains of Escherichia coli). Such human pathogens can colonize plastic surfaces in stable biofilms. The scientific and medical understanding of that health threat of plastic pollution is inadequate but the threat is dealt with as a further aspect of the problem of marine litter discussed in chapter 12. A severe problem could arise in areas that are highly polluted as a result of natural disasters, climate crises or occurring epidemics, or in conflict zones (Vethaak and Leslie, 2016; Keswani and others, 2016; Galloway and others, 2017; Leonard and others, 2018a, 2018b; Moore and others, 2014).

The name of this project is PDET. This project comprises of a fixed central pumping station, PRA-1, a large FSO (2,1 million barrels storage capacity), and two calm buoys systems, at a depth of 100 m. The start-up of this project involves the crude oil from three producing platform; P-52, P-51 and P-53, which are all currently under advanced construction. In the future PDET will receive the production of crude oil from two additional new platforms. Each producing platform will have its own export pipeline, direct to PRA-1. The peak production of this system will achieve 600,000 bbl/day. PRA-1 will have special requirements to pump crude oil either to FSO or to the calm buoys systems. Based on a steel jacket structure the capacity of power generation will be 75 MW, up to 34 inches pigging capacity and many diverse pipings. The FSO has special specifications such as the electrical power and optical swivels, both are at a high level of technology and capacity.

B2069,"The ecosystem approach is one of the most significant approaches to ocean management, consisting of the environmental, social and economic management of human interactions with oceans and coasts at multiple levels (transboundary, regional, national and local). While there is general agreement that the ecosystem approach provides an effective framing of ocean management, further research and capacity-building are needed to realize its full potential benefits across the oceans. Management has two different levels of governance, namely: decision-making processes that provide a framework for making decisions and implementing policy focused on the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources; and management tools (area-based and non-area-based) that can be used to regulate and modify human activity in a particular system.

A1927,"This study measured the wake effect in a Brazilian onshore windfarm with 38 turbines located in complex terrain. The proposed methodology calculated the wind deficit in 3 different metmasts, by comparing the measurement periods in free-of-wake condition to measurement periods under wake effect. Uncertainties due to wind variability and seasonality effects have been avoided by performing MCP (Measure Correlate Predict) procedures making use of a fourth metmast in free-of-wake condition during the entire concurrent period. This methodology is free of uncertainties from Nacelle anemometry, power curve measurements and micrositing models’ spatial extrapolation. The calculation of the wind deficits was performed per sector, confirming the adherence of the resulting wake effect to the turbine layout configuration. Higher wind deficits were identified in the sectors were turbines under operation are present in the upwind direction. The results were combined to the power curves from the turbines closest to the metmasts, using the data from the turbine supplier's technical specification. This allowed the identification of the respective power deficit due to the wake effect in these locations. The calculated wind- and power deficits were compared to the results of wake models used by two large international wind farms site assessment consultants (Coupled Eddy Viscosity and PARK), commonly accepted by banks for the financing of wind farms in Brazil. The results indicated that both models underestimate the effects in all 3 analyzed locations, with differences between the calculated and modeled power deficits higher than the respective uncertainties provided by both consultants. The two main limitations of this analysis lie in the restriction of the wake effect measurement to the metmasts locations, and in that the results are respective to the terrain conditions of the analyzed wind farm. However, this study indicates that commonly used wake models need to be further developed and calibrated for onshore wind farms. The literature shows that wake models developments are frequently directed to offshore wind farms, where wake effects play a significant role. Onshore wind farms are less studied, even though the global installed capacity greatly surpasses that of the offshore wind farms. Brazil has by the end of 2017 already 12.8 GW of installed capacity of wind power plants, and this number continues to increase steadily. With the continuous concentration of operating wind farms in regions of higher wind resource and transmission infrastructure, wake effects play a significant role in the sector. Bibliography shows that commonly used wake models tend to underestimate the energy losses due to this effect in offshore wind farms, making it important to study it also in onshore wind farms in complex terrain, which is the case of most Brazilian wind farms.

A1433,"The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.

B2213,"The ocean is strongly coupled with the atmosphere, mutually transferring substances (mostly gases), heat and momentum at its surface, forming a single coupled system. That system is influenced by the seasonal changes caused by the Earth’s tilted rotation with respect to the sun. Variations in sea-surface temperature among different parts of the ocean are important in creating winds, areas of high and low air pressure and storms (including the highly damaging hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones). In their turn, winds help to shape the surface currents of the ocean, which transport heat from the tropics towards the poles. The ocean surface water arriving in the cold polar regions partly freezes, rendering the remainder more saline and thus heavier. That more saline water sinks to the bottom and flows towards the equator, starting a return flow to the tropics: the meridional overturning circulation, also called the thermohaline circulation. A further overall forcing factor is the movements generated by the tidal system, predominantly driven by the gravitational effect of the moon and sun. The movements of seawater help to control the distribution of nutrients in the ocean. The ocean enjoys both a steady (and, in some places, excessive) input from land of inorganic nutrients needed for plant growth (especially nitrogen, phosphorus and their compounds, but also lesser amounts of other vital nutrients) and a continuous recycling of all the nutrients already in the ocean through biogeochemical processes, including bacterial action. Areas of upwelling, where nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, are particularly important, because they result in a high level of primary production from photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the zone of light penetration, combining carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the other nutrients, and releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Whether in the water column or when it sinks to the seabed, that primary production constitutes the basis on which the oceanic food web is built, through each successive layer up to the top predators (large fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles, seabirds and, through capture fisheries, humans). The distribution of living marine resources around the world is the outcome of that complex interplay of geological forms, ocean currents, nutrient fluxes, weather, seasons and sunlight. Not surprisingly, the resulting distribution of living resources reflects that complexity. Because some ocean areas have high levels of primary production, the density of living marine resources in those areas and the contiguous areas to which currents carry that production is also high. Some of those areas of dense living marine resources are also areas of high biological diversity. The general level of biological diversity in the ocean is also high. For example, just under half of the world’s animal phyla are found only in the ocean, compared to one single phylum found only on land. Human uses of the ocean are shaped not only by the complex patterns of the physical characteristics of the ocean, of its currents and of the distribution of marine life, but also by the terrestrial conditions that have influenced the locations of human settlements, by economic pressures and by the social rules that have developed to control human activities — including national legislation, the law of the sea, international agreements on particular human uses of the sea and broader international agreements that apply to both land and sea.

A470,"This paper describes the history, challenges, solutions and evolution of the Floating Production Units in Brazil. The first floating unit was on stream in 1977 at Campos Basin in Brazil. It produced from a single well with a drilling riser and dry-X-tmas tree to a MODU converted into a floating production unit and exporting to a spread-moored shuttle-tanker by a floating hose. Now, more than 40 years later, over 2,400 meters of water depth at Santos Basin are moored several floating production and storage units (FPSOs). It houses over 40 thousand metric tons of complex topsides exploiting ultra-deep wells from the pre-salt prospects. Along the evolution of the FPSOs, one major stepping-stone was the implementation of lessons learned as a feedback to create a strong foundation. This paper will depict field demands and solutions adopted to deal with the differing climates and environments as well as other particularities to develop FPSOs in Brazil. To face the technological challenges to efficiently and safely produce from ultra-deep water complex pre-salt reservoirs required the consolidated use of the expertise and experience from past projects. Initially Petrobras was well known worldwide as a Semi-Submersible company, with a unique proficiency to develop converted Semi-submersibles and other new constructions. This expertise is still present to this day, but the company has since pioneered and consolidated the use of FPSOs worldwide, leading the industry in this concept. Petrobras led the industry effort to approve FPSO international standards, local regulations with agencies and regulatory bodies by the end of '80s to early '90s. This paper will focus on the evolution of this industry, highlighting the achievements, and address the new developments and opportunities for the future.

A1786,"Located in the Brazilian continental shelf, the so called ""Pre-Salt"" reservoirs with large accumulations of excellent quality, high commercial value light oil have become the most strategic oil production site for Brazil. One of the main challenges that has recently arisen concerns the definition of an adequate process to address the high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) presented in their geological formations. For the Pre-Salt basin, several options of offshore carbon dioxide storage have been studied, such as: aquifers, depleted reservoirs, and salt caverns. Although a mined offshore salt cavern has never been constructed, its adoption has been gaining momentum due to the mantle origin of CO2, the thickness of rock layer above the salt layer, and the lack of reservoirs below the carbonate reservoirs capable to store gases. Because of its unprecedent characteristics, the development of such facility implies a series of challenges in terms of safety and integrity aspects. Using tailored qualitative risk management tools, this paper explores the many aspects and interdependencies of well design, well clustering configuration, drilling, solution mining, CO2 disposal, and abandonment phases related to offshore salt caverns. The results obtained so far indicated that, technically, they are a feasible solution for Pre-Salt CO2 storage. However, economic and environmental viability strongly depends on well clustering configuration and solution mining process.
 ","What is the pre-salt reservoirs?
 ","More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of offshore basins.
 ","They are regions with large accumulations of excellent quality, high commercial value light oil.

A1519,"The northeastern Brazilian continental shelf has a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation system. This study applied statistical analysis on superficial sediments to access the conditions and controls of sedimentary distribution and processes along the outer shelf depositional environment. The total of 123 grabbed sediment samples were analyzed as mean grain size, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The outer shelf presented mean grain size ranging from very coarse sand to very fine sand. Standard deviation ranges from moderately sorted to very poorly sorted. Skewness ranges from strongly fine-skewed to strongly coarse-skewed. Kurtosis intervals range from very platykurtic to very leptokurtic. The bivariant analysis revealed correlations between the statistical parameters and sedimentary facies in three environments: outside the Açu reef (OAR), Açu inter-reef (AIR,) and in the Açu Incised Valley (AIV). The coarse sediments are poorly selected, showed positively skewed essentially, and had the lowest kurtosis values in bioclastic coarse sand of the OAR area related to, whereas medium to fine sands are siliciclastic and bioclastic, moderately sorted, positively skewed, and showed the highest values of kurtosis in the AIR and AIV.

A1427,"In carbonate rock reservoirs, spatial distribution models and elastic properties are complex because of diagenetic processes and mineralogical composition, which together directly interfere with variations in pore shape and interconnectivity. The main objective of this paper is to propose a workflow to aid in three-dimensional quantitative carbonate reservoir characterization of the Quissamã Formation (Macaé Group) in the Pampo field of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. Model-based seismic inversion, sequential Gaussian simulation with cokriging for porosity modeling, and truncated Gaussian simulation with trend for facies modeling were used to characterize the carbonate reservoirs. Our results show that the carbonate platform is located between the upper Aptian and lower Albian seismic surfaces. Interpretation of a new surface, called the intra-Albian, was possible via acoustic-impedance (AI) analysis. Our workflow facilitated identification of low AI, high porosity, and best facies areas in structural highs where the most productive wells have been drilled. Facies modeling suggests that intercalation of facies with high and low porosities is connected to shallowing-upward cycles. Finally, several debris facies with low AI and high porosities were identified in an area that could be targeted for new exploration.

A862,"The increase of oil exploration and production in a given ocean area may put new requirements on the design of mooring systems for the floating units. It is necessary to simplify the underwater layout through the reduction of the lines horizontal span and to allow smaller distance between the production units. In this context the utilisation of taut-leg mooring system seems to be very attractive. The main object of the this paper is to present a comparison between taut-leg and conventional mooring systems in terms of total unit offset and horizontal span. It is presented, initially, the main lines of a synthesis procedure that the authors have developed to select the best configuration for the mooring system, in order to accelerate the search of the solution. In order to make the comparison between the taut-leg and the conventional mooring systems, the synthesis procedure is applied to PETROBRAS semisubmersible platforms SS-20 operating at a water depth varying from 600 to 1000 meters.

A575,"Brazil is entering the age of decommissioning, with aging offshore fields that have been in operation for more than 25 years. Brazil has migrated from an operator's monopolistic environment (with the state owned oil company, Petrobras) to a new reality in which many companies, national and international operate in Brazilian waters. As part of this new reality, Brazil has established government organizations whose aim is to coordinate the exploitation of Brazil's natural resources with the intent of optimizing activities while protecting the environment in an ever increasingly complex eco-system management. Traditionally, offshore projects follow basic phases such as conceptual, front end engineering and design (FEED), detail design, construction and commissioning. Cost allocation and schedules for these phases are all associated with production estimates and return on investment estimates. In many instances, internationally, planning for decommissioning has been deferred to an unforeseen future. Finally that far off horizon has become a reality, and domestic and foreign operators in Brazil are going through a new decommissioning awareness phase. It is the author's opinion that operators wish to comply with a well-defined frame of Brazilian and international regulations. In general, this paper aims at examining the existing regulatory environment and make recommendations on a path forward for: • Clear-cut requirements so that the permitting process flows with a minimized review cycle; • A clear set of rules, defining what abandonment options exist (e.g. complete removal vs. partial removal, on-site abandonment rules for topsides and subsea infrastructure); • A clear set of rules defining fines and sanctions for environmental violations The objectives of this paper are to 1) Gather basic information on the current status of the Brazilian Rules and Regulations, 2) Help non-government entities work together to accomplish the goals set forth by Brazilian lawmakers and officials, and 3) Develop a roadmap for convergence of the environmental agency and project stakeholders. Laws, rules and regulations, and international treaties of which Brazil is signatory are part of this environment.

World production of seaweeds steadily rose from 2012 to 2017 at a rate of about 2.6 per cent annually, or about 1.8 million tons (wet weight) per year, owing mostly to demand from farming and aquaculture, with an estimated value of about $12 billion.

A1915,"This article presents a set of analysis and results on Shared-Actuation Control (SAC) techniques, intended for the remote control of valves in subsea manifolds. The discussion covers historical aspects, including presentation of real cases of SAC in Brazilian fields of Petrobras, as well as covers a conceptualization for the technique. The formulated concepts are used indeed to derive a methodology, intended to guide the development of SAC schemes, during engineering projects of subsea manifolds. The discussion is based in part on the unique experience accumulated by Petrobras in the last 20 years, with the development and introduction of a SAC-based subsea manifold in Campos Basin, Brazil, and the latest development efforts ongoing by 2019 for a new generation of SAC, for the application in subsea manifolds to be installed in ultra-deep waters of Pre-Salt fields, in Santos Basin, Brazil. The methodology proposed in this article is based on a comparative approach which aims to incorporate, on design of SAC, the best engineering practices and lessons learned from traditional Electric-Hydraulic Multiplexed Control Systems (EHMCSs). We refer to such approach as the Inheritance & Counterbalance (I&C) Methodology, since it is based on the application of two specific principles, namely, the Inheritance and Counterbalance Principles. The principles are proposed in this article as well. Taking as starting point a set of technical characteristics of EHMCSs, such as employment of redundant subsea electronics and methods of subsea installation, a subsea engineer can apply the I&C Principles to determine if SAC should inherit a given EHMCS characteristic or, if inheritance is not feasible for some reason, adopt alternative requisites on SAC, in order to counterbalance the effects of such no inheritance. The conceptualization of the I&C Methodology allow us effectively applying it, to obtain as result a table of engineering requisites, suitable for SAC schemes destined to subsea manifolds. The proposed table is presented in this article and incorporates several engineering aspects, which are arbitrated from the knowledge on previous applications of Petrobras in subsea control systems. Such applications include both SAC schemes and EHMCSs, featured on fields of Campos and Santos Basins.

B2027,"The major growth in aquatic production is expected to come from aquaculture and is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030, an increase of 37 per cent over 2016 levels. However, it is estimated that the annual growth rate of aquaculture will slow from 5.7 per cent in the period from 2003 to 2016 to 2.1 per cent in the period from 2017 to 2030, mainly because of a reduced rate of growth in Chinese production, offset in part by an increase in production in other countries (FAO, 2018a). The share of farmed aquatic animal species in global fishery production (for food and non-food uses), which was 47 per cent in 2016, is projected to exceed that of wild species in 2020 and to grow to 54 per cent by 2030. Over 87 per cent of the increase in aquaculture production in 2030 will come from Asian countries. Asia will continue to dominate world aquaculture production, contributing 89 per cent of total production in 2030. China will remain the world’s leading producer, but its share of total production will decrease from 62 per cent in 2016 to 59 per cent in 2030. Production is projected to continue to expand on all continents, with variations in the range of species and products across countries and regions (World Bank, 2013). Millions of people engaged in fisheries and aquaculture are struggling to maintain reasonable livelihoods. These are the people who are most vulnerable to certain climate change impacts, such as extreme weather conditions, storms, floods and rising sea levels, and particular attention needs to be paid to them when designing adaptation measures if the sector is to continue to contribute to meeting the global goals of poverty reduction and food security (FAO, 2018a).

A1703,"Building seismic velocity models honouring complexities evident from seismic data is fundamental to generate inputs for several applications in seismic modeling and imaging. This is particularly important for complex areas, such as the Pre-Salt section of Santos Basin, in the Brazilian offshore. We present a methodology to build velocity models incorporating the geological features identified in legacy seismic data for this basin. Of particular interest is, the internal stratification within the salt section. To characterize a geological layer we propose the use of model-based impedance that combines the geological knowledge from wells and seismic interpretations using rock property relationships. The results are shown in both gathers and stacked migrated sections with improvements in the flattening and the focusing of target reflectors. This approach can also be extended to generate an input velocity model for FWI migration process.

A678,"After the boom of converted floating, production, storage and offloading systems, based on the old VLCC design, many engineering institutes started thinking about optimum dimension for new units. However, these new FPSOs designs carried out worldwide concerns about good seakeeping behavior when considering general weather conditions, in order to apply their project to different locations around the globe. Analyzing the Brazilian specific conditions, it was verified that, considering waves, current and wind characteristics, the dimension proportions found in the projected units were not the best options, mostly because of the swell waves influence. Thus, in a cooperative project between University of Sao Paulo and PETROBRAS, the best dimensions for a specific case were studied, based on real premises from Campos Basin. During the study, the roll motion, which usually creates operational limits during hard environmental conditions, was focused. It was possible not only to evaluate the best breath and draught relations, but also the inclusion of a structured skirt in the ship bilge. The influence of different shapes in the ship's bow and stern were also evaluated, showing interesting results regarding the forces applied on the vessel. All the analyses were conducted considering numerical analysis, and the final dimensions were applied to a scaled model, which allowed to verify the real behavior of the projected unit in a test basin. As a conclusion, it was possible to define an optimized hull for the PETROBRAS premises, giving them a real design to be used in future explorations.

A1903,"With Pre-salt area being a massive new offshore oil frontier, there is a high demand for deepwater floaters for both drilling and production. There are some unique challenges related to the ultra-deepwater (water depth beyond 1500m) and the Brazilian environment for the pre-salt area. Various floater concepts have been evaluated with specific focus for Offshore Brazil applications. This paper provides an overview of the current technology related to dry tree solutions as well as discussion of the pros and cons of various concepts. The paper also discusses some new concepts emerging in the industry attractive for Offshore Brazil. A dry tree solution has the advantage of direct access into reservoirs from the floaters. This allows the operators to drill, complete and workover the well directly from the same hosting unit. The result could be increased reserves and productions in Offshore Brazil as well as significant cost reduction. Proper validation of the concepts and technology qualification of all the systems/components associated with novel technology, establish the basis for a safe and successful project implementation while reducing potential risk to personnel, environment and property. DNV has established processes to systematically evaluate new concepts and new technologies, e.g. Approval in Principle (AiP) and Technology Qualification (TQ). A brief introduction to these processes is included in the paper and how they support the development of these new concepts.

B2277,"Consumption and competition The recovery of several marine mammal populations is generating the potential for conflicts in some regions and opportunities in others. Marine mammals can learn to associate fishing activities with food availability, leading to the development of behaviours to depredate catches from fishing vessels (Tixier and others, 2019) and the creation of conflict with aquaculture operations (Guerra, 2019). After an increase in minke whale catches and a resumption of commercial fin whaling prior to the first Assessment, North Atlantic commercial catches of minke whales have decreased and stabilized, and the commercial catch of fin whales was suspended in 2019 and 2020 (small numbers have been taken since the first Assessment as part of regulated subsistence catches). Over the same period, catches of pinnipeds and other cetaceans in the northern hemisphere have remained relatively stable overall (North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), 2019; International Whaling Commission (IWC), 2019). Catches of baleen whales in the western North Pacific have remained broadly stable since the first Assessment (IWC, 2019, catches taken under special permits) and catches in Antarctic waters were suspended in 2019 (IWC, 2019). Regulated subsistence hunting of marine mammals remains stable (NAMMCO, 2019; IWC, 2019). Two intergovernmental organizations continue to provide a forum for discussions on and the assessment and management of catches of marine mammals: IWC, established in 1946, and NAMMCO, established in 1992. By-caught marine mammals can complement fishery catches for human consumption. This practice can be further complemented by hunting or the use of stranded animals in some countries (Robards and Reeves, 2011). Marine mammals used in such a way has been termed “aquatic wild meat” or “marine bushmeat”, the latter as an analogy with terrestrial bushmeat used to support food security in deprived regions (Cosentino and Fisher, 2016; Clapham and Van Waerebeek, 2007). The catch and consumption of coastal species in lower latitudes are likely to have increased (Robards and Reeves, 2011), in particular in South-East Asia and West Africa (Porter and Lai, 2017; Liu and others, 2019; Mintzer and others, 2018; Van Waerebeek and others, 2017), where the sustainability of such practices is often unknown. As habitat change associated with climate change redistributes species and has a potential impact on population abundances (Moore and Reeves, 2018), communities relying on the harvesting of marine mammals for food are also likely to be affected, resulting in future food security challenges (Brinkman and others, 2016). Marine mammals remain culturally significant, with objects created from body parts and as part of the imagery of coastal traditions and cultures. This cultural heritage is key to community cohesion and identity and includes unique elements, such as cooperative fishing between people and dolphins in Brazil (Daura-Jorge and others, 2012).
 ","What particular locations may have increased the catch and consumption of coastal species?
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio).

B2450,"Technological advancesAreas beyond national jurisdiction have become increasingly accessible owing to technological advancements that facilitate the exploration and exploitation of deep-sea resources, including biodiversity, minerals, oil and gas. Ensuring the sustainable development of those regions will require international cooperation in order to manage them effectively. Negotiations on a legally binding international instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction are focused on ensuring the sustainable development and conservation of those areas (see also chap. 28). The International Seabed Authority has a dual mandate of promoting the development of deep-sea minerals, while ensuring that such development is not harmful to the environment. In areas beyond national jurisdiction, appropriate planning will be required to minimize impacts on the marine environment. The uptake of technological advances for accessing and utilizing marine resources, sustainably developing marine industries and effectively managing those uses is not globally even. Many regions, in particular those where the least developed countries are located, still lack access to technologies that can assist with the sustainable use of marine resources.Changing governance structures and geopolitical instabilityThere has been an increase in nationalism and protectionism over the past decade, contributing to changing trade agreements and, more recently, the implementation of tariffs on goods between specific countries. The Democracy Index fell from 5.55 in 2014 to 5.44 in 2019, largely driven by the regional deterioration of conditions in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. When indices for individual countries are calculated, stark regional differences are evident. Countries in Scandinavia, the far north of North America and the South-West Pacific had the highest indices, while those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia had the lowest. Those differences have an impact on the implementation of global and regional treaties and agreements, thereby affecting economic growth, the transfer of technologies and the implementation of frameworks for managing ocean use, including the development of national ocean-related policies. That, therefore, affects the sustainability of human activities and the protection of marine ecosystems in those areas.Climate changeClimate change effects are not uniform across the global ocean. A number of regions are warming at higher rates than the global average and are identified as marine hotspots (Hobday and Pecl, 2014). A number of those hotspots are located where human dependence on marine resources is greatest, such as South-East Asia and Western Africa, with substantive implications for food security compared with other regions. The Arctic is another region where the ocean is warming at 2 to 3 times above the global average (IPCC, 2018). Similarly, decreases in the pH and carbonate ion concentrations of the ocean, associated with ocean acidification, and other effects of climate change, such as deoxygenation, stratification and sea level rise, are regionally variable, with highly variable impacts on the marine environment. Regional differences in such changes are described in detail in chapter 5, and the pressures that they are generating, including socioeconomic impacts, are described in detail in chapter 9.
 ","Why are some regions identified as marine hotspots?

B2256,"Consequences of changes for human communities, economies and well-being The most significant impact of the use of plastic in products and packaging is marine pollution (UNEP, 2014), but it is important to emphasize that it is difficult to quantify the economic impact of marine litter. Based on figures from 2011, the economic costs of marine plastic, in relation to marine natural capital, are conservatively conjectured to be between $3,300 and $33,000 per ton per year (Beaumont and others, 2019). While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019). More recently (McIlgorm and others, 2020), a ninefold increase in the direct economic costs of marine litter was found from 2009 to 2015, reaching $10.8 billion. In addition to indirect impacts (i.e., on biodiversity and ecosystems), beach litter is perhaps the most visible direct impact and affects the patrimonial value of coastal areas that can be translated as the financial expenditure of cleaning up (UNEP, 2019). Damage and costs to marine ecosystems and services must be considered in the future despite an actual limited understanding of the detrimental impacts on the structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem. Marine litter can also result in increased costs for the shipping sector and recreational activities, including yachting (e.g., fouled motors, entangled propellers, lost output and repair costs) (Hong and others, 2017), but the damage and associated social costs extend to other sectors such as aquaculture and fisheries. The removal of 10 per cent of derelict fishing pots alone would provide estimated additional revenues of $831 million annually for the global crustacean fishery industry (Scheld and others, 2016). Most microplastics in marine organisms are found in their digestive system, which people do not ordinarily consume, with the exception of shellfish and small fish that are eaten whole. Besides accidents and injuries, there is no evidence that microplastics concentrations have a negative impact on fish and shellfish health or commercial stocks (Barboza and others, 2018). Links to human health are not sufficiently addressed, and gaps in knowledge are even greater in relation to nanoplastics (< 1 micron), in particular their absorption and behaviour (GESAMP, 2016; see also chap. 8) and how they may pass through biological barriers via different mechanisms (Wright and Kelly, 2017). As relevant toxicity data are absent, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that it was currently not possible to evaluate the human health risk of nanoplastics and microplastics (European Food Safety Authority Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2016). Moreover, there are indications that microplastic fibre ingestion by humans through the consumption of contaminated seafood is only a minimal contribution to the microplastic contamination of the total food basket (Catarino and others, 2018).
 ","What is the financial impact for the global crustacean fishery industry to remove ten per cent of derelict fishing pots?

A706,"Lankhorst Ropes will supply a synthetic high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) mooring rope, the Gama 98 rope construction, to Brazilian oil and gas producer Petrobras, which is developed by the company specifically for deepwater mooring and used on a number of major deepwater projects in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). This will be the first time the 630-metric-ton minimum breaking load (MBL) rope with Dyneema, comprising 12 sub-ropes of SK78 yarn, has been used for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) mooring. HMPE is a stiffer yarn than polyester and so its elasticity is significantly less, making it more riser friendly. Although HMPE's creep performance prevents its use for permanent deepwater mooring, it is believed that a polyester/HMPE hybrid mooring system offers the best permanent mooring solution beyond 6,500 ft. The principle benefit of hybrid PE/HMPE ropes is the ability for the mooring system designer to engineer the mooring line's stiffness and use the lengths of polyester and HMPE segments to provide the stiffness needed to handle peak loads during station-keeping.

A1484,"Many estuaries present natural harbor conditions with relatively calm and shallow waters that provide a connection between the ocean and continental waterways. The increase in the demand for goods by the constant growing of the world population has forced estuaries to be altered by human activities, such as dredging, in order to maintain a safe navigation system. The development of sophisticated morphological and hydrodynamic models opened a new perspective of assisting dredging operations inside different estuaries. Thus, the aim of this study is to apply a hydromorphodynamic model to simulate the bed evolution of the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil. The results of the simulation were applied in a dredge operation model to simulate dredging inside the waterway of the Rio Grande harbor, located inside the Patos Lagoon estuary. The salinity and current velocities inside the estuary were well represented by the model simulations. An annual mean discharge of 3 407 ms3 s?1 was calculated for the lagoon for the year 2004. The morphodynamic model successfully represented the silted and eroded scenarios for the estuarine channel. The dredge operation model results affirm that dredging of the channel causes significant variations in estuarine physical parameters such as salinity, current velocity and suspended sediment concentration. The bed evolution results indicate that a fast siltation of the channel occurs right after dredging stops, stabilizing the variations after a 60-day period.

Combined with paraffin deposits, the production flowline of the best offshore producer in northeast Brazil was completely blocked. Extensive planning was necessary to spot the coiled tubing (CT) equipment to accommodate the deck configuration of the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and to overcome dimensional and load capacity limitations. A customized extendable jacking frame was manufactured to support the CT injector and provide room for a work window. This fit-for-purpose rigging was necessary to enable the viability of the cleanout in the production flowline of the well. CT operation modeling software was used to analyze the hydraulic and force simulations to verify that the CT would reach the target depth with optimal jetting efficiency and would tailor the cleanout methodology. Paraffin was successfully cleaned from the flowline, and the PIG was released and recovered on surface. The CT was efficiently and safely rigged up on a FPSO without any nonproductive time or service quality issues. The versatility of CT services to not only deliver intervention services on conventional wells but to also adapt to rig up in extreme geometries and environments are showcased along with how CT services can be applied to flowline interventions. For this case, a customized CT frame was manufactured to overcome the challenges of rigging up on a vessel with extremely limited deck space and load capacities and restoring hydrocarbon production after a failed PIG procedure.

A789,"Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil. The recently created Petrobras Heavy Oil Technological Program - PROPES - is in charge of the development, together with universities, service companies and the industry, of new technologies for the offshore heavy oil fields.

The information intends to serve as baseline of the plankton C, N, and P stoichiometry for the calibration of biogeochemical and ecological models in support to future findings related to the local and regional phenomena of climatic change. Cabo Frio Bay is a small semienclosed system set adjacent to a region subject to sporadic coastal upwelling. Zooplankton exhibited average annual C, N, and P contents of 11.6 ± 6.9 %, 2.8 ± 1.8 %, and 0.18 ± 0.08 %, and phytoplankton (>20 μm) 6.8 ± 6.0 %, 1.6 ± 1.5 %, and 0.09 ± 0.08 %, respectively. The C/N/P ratios correspond to the lowest already found to date for a marine environment. The low C contents must have been brought about by a predominance of gelatinous zooplankton, like Doliolids/ Salps and also Pteropods. Average annual nutrient concentrations in the water were 0.21 ± 0.1 μM for phosphate, 0.08 ± 0.1 μM for nitrite, 0.74 ± 1.6 μM for nitrate, and 1.27 ± 1.1 μM for ammonium. N/P ratios were around 8:1 during the first study period and 12:1 during the second. The plankton C/N/P and N/P nutrient ratios and elemental concentrations suggest that the system was oligotrophic and nitrogen limited. The sporadic intrusions of upwelling waters during the first study period had no marked effect upon the systems metabolism, likely due to dilution effects and the short residence times of water of the bay.

A401,"This paper shows work performed through a Joint Industry Project (JIP), aimed to enable repairs made from composite materials to be applied to metallic structural components of offshore platforms in general and FPSOs in particular. The basic motivation was to provide a repair methodology that would cause a reduced impact to platform operations, particularly in classified areas. The focus on FPSOs derived from the fact that most of them are converted tankers, originally designed for overhauling in suitable docks from time to time. That is no longer possible once they are deployed as floating platforms, intended to stay in place for twenty years or more. An important prerequisite was that the repair procedure had necessarily to have the approval of the Classification Society of the platform. The project was conducted in three phases. The objective of the first phase was to develop a qualification procedure for the repair of relevant defects with adhesive patches and to demonstrate its feasibility with simple examples. Along phase two a Project Recommended Practice for Patch Repair was issued and more qualification tests were performed. Phase three consisted of a practical application of the Recommended Practice, accomplished within Petrobras by a repair at a ballast tank of the production semisubmersible platform P-20, in operation at Campos basin. The repair was accomplished by means of carbon fiber reinforcements within a vinylester matrix. This paper describes the P-20 repair case and the design of the bonded repair. A brief overview is presented of the installation of the repair, quality assurance issues and needs for future follow-up. The experimental and theoretical studies performed in support of the repair trial are briefly described. The successful repair trial demonstrates the utility of bonded repairs in managing the integrity of offshore steel structure assets.

A1309,"The development of Brazil Offshore fields using flexible pipes took the advantage of the possibility to move around lines, anticipate the production and postpone the decision of where exactly the development phase wells should be placed, making the drilling campaign easier, cheaper and faster. For the Pre-Salt fields, mainly in Santos Basin, it is observed high concentrations of H2S and CO2, two major impact contaminants for the metallic layers of the flexible pipe. A new failure mode by SCC is the most concerning one and have several approaches either focused on the installed fleet or focused in the next pipes to be delivered. SCC is a condition that induces cracks in the pipes metallic layers and need three elements to happen: water, stress and susceptible material. If one of these three elements is suppressed, the phenomena is not to happen. This paper will cover and present a design of a seal tight end fitting also with capabilities to be seal tested from the shop during the factory acceptance test and further means to identify if the flexible pipe section is flooded or dry visually, using ROV.

B2313,"Climate change Climate has always been a major influence on the marine environment, with high natural variability from year to year and longer-term variability associated with climate phenomena at the regional and global levels. However, there is strong evidence that the climate is changing at a rate unprecedented in the geological record. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019), summarizes historic and recent patterns in the global climate and provides projections of changes under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise over the period since the first Assessment, with global CO2 emissions increasing from 30.4 gigatons in 2010 to 33.3 gigatons in 2019. The growth in emissions has resulted in widespread reduction of the cryosphere (frozen-water parts of the planet), continued increases in ocean temperature, decreases in ocean pH and oxygen, shifts in currents and increases in extreme events such as heatwaves (IPCC, 2019). Those changes are described in detail in chapter 5, and the pressures that they are generating, including socioeconomic impacts, are described in detail in chapter 9. Following on from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (which entered into force in 1994) and the Kyoto Protocol (which entered into force in 2005), the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, at its twenty-first session, adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015. The Agreement is aimed at strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is recognized in the Agreement that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation of all countries. It is also recognized that deep reductions in global emissions will be required in order to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention. In its report on global warming of 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined the mitigation pathways compatible with a 1.5°C warming of the global climate, likely impacts associated with such warming and what would be needed in response to such a change. It highlighted that warming from anthropogenic emissions would persist for centuries to millenniums and would continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, including the ocean. Interactions between climate change and other drivers include influencing the distribution of global populations as people shift from increasingly uninhabitable areas, economic impacts, including those associated with food production (e.g., aquaculture and fisheries), and an ever greater need for technological innovations and solutions to reduce greenhouse gases, including further reliance on marine renewable energy.
 ","When did the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change enter into force?
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio). In addition, there is some evidence related to the increase of some harmful algal species related to climate warming in some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016).

A1422,"We present the first evidence of Archean oceanic crust submitted to Proterozoic high-pressure (HP) metamorphism in the South American Platform. Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf isotopic data combined with U–Pb geochronological data from the Campo Grande area, Rio Grande do Norte domain, in the Northern Borborema Province, reflect a complex Archean (2.9 ​Ga and 2.6 ​Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (2.0 ​Ga) evolution, culminating in the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano/Pan-African orogeny (ca. 600 Ma). The preserved mafic rocks contain massive poikiloblastic garnet and granoblastic amphibole with variable proportions of plagioclase ​+ ​diopside in symplectitic texture, typical of high-pressure rocks. These clinopyroxene-garnet amphibolites and the more common garnet amphibolites from the Campo Grande area are exposed as rare lenses within an Archean migmatite complex. The amphibolite lenses represent 2.65 ​Ga juvenile tholeiitic magmatism derived from depleted mantle sources (positive εHf(t) values of +3.81 to +30.66) later enriched by mantle metasomatism (negative εNd(t) values of –7.97). Chondrite and Primitive Mantle-normalized REE of analyzed samples and discriminant diagrams define two different oceanic affinities, with E-MORB and OIB signature. Negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu∗ ​= ​0.75–0.95) indicate depletion of plagioclase in the source. Inherited zircon cores of 3.0–2.9 ​Ga in analyzed samples indicate that the Neoarchean tholeiitic magmatism was emplaced into 2923 ​± ​14 ​Ma old Mesoarchean crust (εNd(t) ​= ​–2.58 and Nd TDM ​= ​3.2 ​Ga) of the Rio Grande do Norte domain. The age of retro-eclogite facies metamorphism is not yet completely understood. We suggest that two high-grade metamorphic events are recognized in the mafic rocks: the first at 2.0 ​Ga, recorded in some samples, and the second, at ca. 600 Ma, stronger and more pervasive and recorded in several of the mafic rock samples. The Neoproterozoic zircon grains are found in symplectite texture as inclusions in the garnet grains and represent the age of HP conditions in the area. These zircon grains show a younger cluster of concordant analyses between 623 ​± ​3 ​Ma and 592 ​± ​5 ​Ma with εHf(t) values of +0.74 to –65.88. Thus, the Campo Grande rock assemblage is composed of Archean units that were amalgamated to West Gondwana during Neoproterozoic Brasiliano orogeny continent-continent collision and crustal reworking.

B2446,"As of 2012, about 80 per cent of seaweeds were either consumed directly, such as kelps, or processed for phycocolloids, such as carrageenan, for use in the food industry. The rest were used widely in pet food and in industrial, cosmetic and medical applications. World production of seaweeds steadily rose from 2012 to 2017 at a rate of about 2.6 per cent annually, or about 1.8 million tons (wet weight) per year, owing mostly to demand from farming and aquaculture, with an estimated value of about $12 billion. China remains the top producer of seaweeds, followed by Indonesia. The Philippines is still the world’s third largest producer, despite being struck by typhoons every year; Filipino seaweed farmers have become resilient and can revive their farming operations immediately. The Republic of Korea ranks fourth and has made a concerted effort to increase exports to North America through marketing campaigns. The top species farmed are still the carrageenophytes, Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma spp. (accounting for 85 per cent of world’s carrageenan production), which are grown in the Indo-Pacific region; alginate-producing kelps (Saccharina and Undaria), which are cold-water species, are the major species harvested. Emerging applications of seaweeds in agriculture include their use for the reduction of methane production in farmed animals, but such applications are still incipient because of issues relating to bromoforms, which can have environmental consequences.

A1293,"The discovery of large oil accumulations in the rift and sag Pre-Salt sections of the Campos and Santos Basins has revived interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins. More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins. A study integrating systematic petrography, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin. This study highlights the major primary, diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession, with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones, syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite, and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites. Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits. In the sag phase, stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites, which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits. In the rift section, stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites. Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution. Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution, neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift, as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites, silica and dolomite in the sag section. Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal fluids carried through faults and fracture systems. These fluids promote dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution at varying degrees and intensities. Eodiagenetic precipitation and dissolution owing to variations in the lake water chemistry and the episodic flow of hydrothermal fluids under burial conditions control the creation, redistribution, and obliteration of porosity in the Pre-Salt reservoirs.

A701,"On January 18, 2000, approximately 340,000 gallons (1,300 m3) of marine fuel (MF-380) spilled into Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The spill originated from a leak in the pipeline from the PETROBRAS refinery to the oil terminal. This paper presents the results for the water column and sediment monitoring 10 days after the spill, including n-alkanes, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and toxicological essays. Chemical and toxicological monitoring of the water column was performed at 14 sampling stations throughout the impacted area in Guanabara Bay. The chemical analysis of PAHs by ultraviolet fluorescence showed results from <0.04–11.56 μg/L−1 in chrysene equivalents. The toxicological essays for three species (Artemia sp., Mysidium gracile, and Vibrio fisheri, Microtox) indicate no acute effects for the water samples studied. To monitor sediments, 57 samples were collected from intertidal and sub tidal sites. For the 30 intertidal sediments, 73% contained PAHs (GC-MS) below 2 μg/g−1, 20% were in the range 2–5 μg/g−1, and only two stations (7%), located in the vicinity of the spill point, contained levels up to 20 μg/g−1. For the 27 subtidal sediments, results were in the range of 0.2–9.6 μg/g−1 for PAHs, 0.7–43.3 μg/g−1 for n-alkanes, and 17.8–1,250 μg/g−1 for UCM. The toxicological study for the sediments based on Vibrio fisheri (Microtox) indicated no acute toxicity effects. When comparing the post-spill results with previous hydrocarbon data, no significant impact was observed in sediments and water column because of the oil spill. There is, however, a significant background of chronic anthropogenic inputs to Guanabara Bay.

A1322,"This work intends to understand how the Ponta do Mel carbonate platform was implanted, to characterize its depositional model and its evolution in the light of modern stratigraphy, as well as to understand the stratigraphic relations with beneath, overlapping and contemporary units, from wells and seismic data. The focus area of this study corresponds to a belt in the offshore portion of the Potiguar Basin, which runs parallel to the shoreline, about 40 km from it. The carbonate rocks of the Ponta do Mel Formation date from the Late Albian and, similar to what occurs in the other basins of the Brazilian continental margin, their deposition is related to the separation events of the African and South American continents. In the stratigraphic analysis of the wells (1D analysis), it was possible to characterize carbonate lithofacies, that are the predominant, as well as mixed and siliciclastic lithofacies. It was also possible to individualize shallowing upward cycles and cycle sets, which were associated with the identified systems tracts. In the seismic stratigraphic analysis, in the same way, four seismic facies were visualized, which, in general, are related to the tractive processes involved in the deposition of the carbonate, mixed and siliciclastic lithofacies, defined in the 1D analysis. The integration of the results from the well data analysis to the seismic stratigraphic analysis allowed to understand that the studied interval, which coincides, in lithostratigraphic terms, with the Ponta do Mel Formation, represents a complete depositional sequence, here referred to as the Albian-Cenomanian Sequence, formed by the Lowstand Systems Tract (LST), Transgressive Systems Tract (TST), and Highstand Systems Tract (HST). The sedimentation history of the Ponta do Mel unit started from the deposition of siliciclastic and carbonate facies in a shallow water platform environment. Then, with the increase in the accommodation space, in a transgressive phase, a thick interval of deeper water facies, represented mainly by calcilutites and pelitic rocks, was deposited. At the end of this interval, facies of coarser granulation, represented mainly by thick calcarenites layers, and sometimes calcirrudites, started to dominate the platform scenario, denoting a regressive phase and thus ending the Albian-Cenomanian Sequence.

B2426,"Extreme climate events The El Niño Southern Oscillation is a coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon, identified by an oscillation between warm and cold ocean temperatures in the tropical central eastern Pacific Ocean and an associated fluctuation in the global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure patterns. Typically, it has a preferred timescale of about two to seven years. It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti, French Polynesia, and Darwin, Australia, and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (Rasmussen and Carpenter, 1982). It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world through global teleconnections. The warm phase of the Oscillation is called El Niño and the cold phase is called La Niña. The strongest El Niño and La Niña events since the pre-industrial era have occurred during the past 50 years, and that variability is unusually high when compared with average variability during the last millennium (Cobb and others, 2013; Santoso and others, 2017). There have been three occurrences of extreme El Niño events during the modern observational period (1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16), all characterized by pronounced rainfall in the normally dry equatorial East Pacific. There have been two occurrences of extreme La Niña (1988/89, 1998/99). Extreme El Niño and La Niña events are likely to occur more frequently with global warming and are likely to intensify existing impacts, with drier or wetter responses in several regions across the globe, even at relatively low levels of future global warming (Cai and others, 2014; Cai and others, 2015; Power and Delage, 2018).

A568,"Two of the biggest drivers in Middle East oil & gas operations today are the continued development and upgrade of existing facilities (Brownfield Projects) and the challenges involved in developing high pressure, high temperature (HP/HT) fields. These developments come with very different piping and pipeline challenges. In the case of Brownfield projects, it is the ageing piping installations with increased corrosion and leaks, and the need to carry out piping modifications while continuing production. And in the case of HP/HT developments, the challenges include the need to develop robust and effective instrumentation, reliable connections, reduce subsea intervention costs, and operate around existing infrastructure. This paper will look at how cold-work piping connection solutions can accommodate the challenges involved in Brownfield projects and HP/HT applications, as well as alleviating concerns over traditional methods, such as welding. Such concerns include time, cost, resources, and safety implications. Referring to the experience gained from installing over 3,000 cold-work connections worldwide, this paper will examine how cold-work solutions generate a simple mechanical connection; the technology of using hydraulic pipes to flange expansion in developing leak-free connections; the importance of no gasket, seals or moving parts in the connection; and the flexibility needed to handle a range of piping diameters. The paper will provide an example of a recent topside cold-work installation offshore Abu Dhabi - on a field in production for more than 40 years, where the cold-work piping technology was found to significantly reduce the traditional work scope. It will also provide an overview of the choices in taking the technology subsea and applications for critical, high pressure applications through recent testing with Petrobras in Brazil The paper will provide an important technical contribution to Middle Eastern operators in the form of i) a low impact and flexible piping solution that reduces production shut-down time; ii) increased safety; and iii) introduce significant financial savings.

This established a record for the Brazilian state oil company in jacket installation. The structure is located in 142-m water in Campos Basin. In establishing this record, the piles were driven to maximum penetration of 110 m. The jacket, designed by Interconsult (Micoperi), presented a new concept for steel jackets using vertical external skirt piles. The concept eliminated the need for pile guides and enabled the 160-m-long piles to be installed and driven in a single piece. This permitted fast installation in an area of the open South Atlantic subject to severe seas of long period swells almost the entire year. The concept also reduces both overall weight and fabrication time.

A1815,"By monitoring the variation of weights of floating production units (FPUs), the sum of total weight computed by load calculators on board very often does not match the actual displacement based on the current drafts. Differences can also be observed in the trim and heel of FPUs, which present values different from zero degree in the calculations, but in fact they are frequently kept near zero by ballast control. The mooring lines and risers tensions are one of the most uncertain weight items in loading conditions reported by the crew on board, therefore, this paper aims to assess the influence and behavior of these systems to a variety of situations in which FPUs operate. Analyses were performed for semi-submersibles and FPSOs considering two configurations of mooring system: catenary and taut-leg. The purpose is to evaluate how the magnitude of the resulting force varies-and hence how the trim and heel change-for a range of offsets caused by environmental conditions. The effect of mooring lines and risers is also discussed regarding the water depth by means of case studies considering a range of water depths. Actual lines properties and seabed bathymetry from mooring system models of platforms located offshore Brazil have been taken as reference. In short, the mooring lines and risers loads will be calculated for different types of floating production units, mooring system configurations and water depths in order to evaluate their influence on the trim, heel and displacement of FPUs.

A1528,"This paper presents a methodology to estimate the thickness loss on hulls of Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platforms under general corrosion. The main purpose is to define characteristic corrosion rates for structural reassessment of the extension of life of FPSOs considering results of previous in-life inspections. The steel wear generates sectional loss and capacity reduction, possibly leading to structural failure. Being capable of estimating FPSO's plates and stiffeners thickness along the operational life would be a considerable safety improvement for the whole industry, benefiting operators and classifications societies. During this research, different models were investigated to define the proposed methodology: (a) Model A (Garbatov and Soares [1,2]); (b) Model B (Melchers et al. [3-11] and, the one considered more appropriate to this study, Model C (Paik et al. [12,16]). The proposed approach, based on Paik et al (2003), considers that the results of thickness loss readings in inspections during the operational life of the FPSO may be modeled by the Weibull model. Then, this model is applied to estimate the characteristic corrosion rate for the structural reassessment of FPSO extension life.

B2283,"Impacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere Sea-surface temperature The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reaffirmed in its fifth report its conclusion that global sea-surface temperatures have increased since the late nineteenth century. Upper-ocean temperature (and hence its heat content) varies over multiple time scales, including seasonal, inter-annual (for example, those associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation), decadal and centennial periods. Depth-averaged ocean-temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive (that is, they show warming) over most of the globe. The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic. Zonally averaged upper-ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths. However, the greater volume of the ocean in the southern hemisphere increases the contribution of its warming to the global heat content. The ocean’s large mass and high heat capacity enable it to store huge amounts of energy, more than 1,000 times than that found in the atmosphere for an equivalent increase in temperature. The earth is absorbing more heat than it is emitting back into space, and nearly all that excess heat is entering the ocean and being stored there. The ocean has absorbed about 93 per cent of the combined extra heat stored by warmed air, sea, land, and melted ice between 1971 and 2010. During the past three decades, approximately 70 per cent of the world’s coastline has experienced significant increases in sea-surface temperature. This has been accompanied by an increase in the yearly number of extremely hot days along 38 per cent of the world’s coastline. Warming has also been occurring at a significantly earlier date in the year along approximately 36 per cent of the world’s temperate coastal areas (between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres). That warming is resulting in an increasingly poleward distribution of many marine species.
 ","Why the concern about the increase of the sea-surface temperature must be even higher than those from other sources?
 ","Ocean's large mass and high heat capacity enable it to store more than 1000 times the energy found in the atmosphere, for the same increase in temperature. In fact, the ocean has absorbed almost 93% of the extra heat stored from other sources combined from 1971 and 2010.
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio). In addition, there is some evidence related to the increase of some harmful algal species related to climate warming in some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016).

A339,"The SCR (Steel Catenary Riser) was adopted by Petrobras as a cost-effective alternative for oil and gas export lines on deepwater fields, where large diameter flexible risers present technical and economic limitations. The SCR structures are subjected to several types of loads during their service life. These loads may be static or dynamic. When installed, the action of environmental phenomena like wind, current and sea waves on the floating unit, induces motions that will be transferred to the riser top connection. The random time domain dynamic analysis approach is considered to be more suitable to represent the loads and also die structural response due to the capability to represent existing non-linearities in the model. The sea-state spectra are treated by a time-simulation method, so fluid load non-linearity and fluid-structure interaction are well represented. Structural non-linearity, drag forces, fluid-structure relative velocity, and sea surface level variations are also taken into account. The fatigue damage calculation is directly related with stresses ranges composed along the whole structure service life. The load sets used in such analysis should be complete enough to represent all possible significant situations. This procedure results in a high computer time consuming necessary for several time-domain analyses, that is not compatible with a typical design schedule. Therefore, the load cases have to be reduced without lack of accuracy or safety. This paper presents the approach and methodology adopted in Petrobras to verify the SCR fatigue damage. The analysis performed and presented used the Petrobras's in-house computer codes ANFLEX and POSFAL, which were specially upgraded for this purpose.

A740,"Well integrity has always been a major concern during the well design phase. But after some of the recent events in the oil industry, Macondo being the one still fresh in everyone's mind, it has turned into a critical concern. The need for monitoring well integrity, from the construction through its lifetime, became unavoidable. In particular, for Petrobras Pre-Salt fields, these concerns are boosted by the uncertainties in the salt layer geomechanical properties and its interaction with the cement and casing. Wells in the Pre-salt are designed for a 30 year lifespan, with a minimum number of interventions during their lifespan. Indeed, the expected interval between interventions is not shorter than 10 years, even for recompletion, making traditional cement or casing logging tools less useful. Continuous monitoring may provide not only the current status of the casing or cementing but also the evolution of the parameters, allowing a condition based (predictive) intervention to be planned. A research and development project is being conducted to investigate, design and evaluate continuous monitoring tools to verify and ensure the integrity of the cement sheath and of the casing. The first and more obvious challenge is to install sensors in the casing annulus: there are severe restrictions in footprint of the components; there is also the problem of getting the data to the surface without compromising well safety barriers. The required metrology need to be investigated in order to determine the best sensing technology for each parameter, and even those must be determined to achieve the best correlation with well integrity status. This paper discusses the current perspectives on the monitoring of well integrity. Parameters already identified and some alternatives to monitor them will also be presented.

B2061,"Impacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere Sea-level rise It is very likely that extreme sea-level maxima have already increased globally since the 1970s, mainly as a result of global mean sea-level rise. That rise is due in part to anthropogenic warming, causing ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and of the polar continental ice sheets. Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion. Some of the remainder is due to fluxes of freshwater from the continents, which have increased as a result of the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets. Finally, regional and local sea-level changes are also influenced by natural factors, such as regional variability in winds and ocean currents, vertical movements of the land, isostatic adjustment of the levels of land in response to changes in physical pressures on it and coastal erosion, combined with human perturbations by change in land use and coastal development. As a result, sea levels will rise more than the global mean in some regions, and will actually fall in others. A 4°C warming by 2100 (which is predicted in the high-end emissions scenario in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) would lead, by the end of that period, to a median sea-level rise of nearly 1 metre above the 1980 to 1999 levels. Ocean acidification Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are resulting in increased uptake of that gas by the ocean. There is no doubt that the ocean is absorbing more and more of it: about 26 per cent of the increasing emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, where it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid. The resulting acidification of the ocean is occurring at different rates around the seas, but is generally decreasing the levels of calcium carbonate dissolved in seawater, thus lowering the availability of carbonate ions, which are needed for the formation by marine species of shells and skeletons. In some areas, this could affect species that are important for capture fisheries.

A928,"Brazilian carbonate reservoirs contain huge oil-in-place volumes and are likely to have an important economic impact in global oil industry. Such carbonate reservoirs, both Albian and Aptian, are located offshore in deep water, which has an important role in development costs. In siliciclastic plays it is standard practice to use time-lapse (4D) seismic to locate wells in unswept areas, maximizing the recovery factor. However, in carbonate plays, time-lapse seismic monitoring remains challenging, with few cases of success published around the world. Carbonates differ from siliciclastic rocks in many aspects. With a varied chemical composition and complex pore connectivity, carbonates bring on a large diversity of facies, each one showing a specific seismic response. Moreover, the usually high incompressibility of the carbonate matrix reduces sensitivity to pressure and saturation changes, which are the main effects expected on a hydrocarbon field undergoing production. Considering both the economic relevance and the difficulties of using time-lapse seismic to monitor carbonate reservoirs, Petrobras created a strategic program to face this challenge, a time-lapse seismic (S4D) study of an Albian carbonate reservoir located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Three legacy data were available: streamer-1987, streamer-2002, and ocean-bottom cable-2010. Extensive feasibility studies are performed as well as a meticulous prestack 4D simultaneous inversion based on the seismic data, preliminary cross-equalized to partially overcome the initial low repeatability. A multidisciplinary interpretation conducted by a team of geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers finally lead to results overcoming expectations. Saturation and pressure changes are detected using P-and S-impedance attributes, consistent with production data. Results are opening perspectives for further monitoring other carbonate reservoirs, especially with new presalt Brazilian discoveries in the Campos and Santos Basins, which might have a huge economic impact.

B2419,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Impacts of disturbance from noise Anthropogenic noise in the ocean increased in the last half of the past century. Commercial shipping is the main source, and the noise that it produces is often in frequency bands used by many marine mammals for communication. Many other types of marine biotas have also been shown to be affected by anthropogenic noise. Other significant sources of noise are seismic exploration for the offshore hydrocarbon industry and sonar. The impact of noise can be both to disrupt communication among animals and to displace them from their preferred breeding, nursery or feeding grounds, with consequent potential effects on their breeding success and survival. Impacts of recreational fishing Recreational fishing is a popular activity in many industrialized countries, in which up to 10 per cent of the adult population may participate. The impact of that type of fishing is only sometimes taken into account in fishery management, although the quantities caught can be significant for the management of stocks experiencing overfishing. In several countries, there is a substantial industry supporting the recreational catching of sport fish (including trophy fish, such as marlins, swordfish and sailfish), but catch statistics are generally not available.

The lithology of reservoirs in the Igarape Cuia oil and gas field, the oil and gas field of Urucu and the Barra Bonita gasfield, were previously thought to be volcanic rocks, but now are clastic rocks according to studies, and the igneous rocks in these three oil and gas field can only be acted as indirect and direct cap rocks. Furthermore, igneous rock reservoirs in the Campos Basin and Santos Basin in the Brazilian offshore are briefly analyzed. The representative Badejo oilfield in the Campos Basin has igneous rock reservoirs dominated by basalts which are intercalated with thin layers of volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks, the storage space are vesicules, fractures and vugular pores, and the porosity of hydrocarbon bearing interval basalt reservoirs ranges from 10% to 15%. In addition, for the Santos Basin, igneous rocks in this basin are dominated by basic rocks, some alkaline intrusive rocks develop good micro spaces, mainly crystal moldic pores, inter- and intra-crystal dissolution pores and fractures, better reservoir intervals are often concentrated such as at sections near to unconformity surfaces and can have porosity of 6%–9% or higher; local pre-salt igneous rock reservoirs in the Santos Basin have the necessary conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation and it will be a new target layer for hydrocarbon exploration.

A1462,"Hybridization between sea turtle species occurs with particularly high frequency at two adjacent nesting areas in northeastern Brazil. To understand the outcomes of hybridization and their consequences for sea turtle conservation, we need to evaluate the extent of hybridization occurrence and possible deleterious effects in the hybrid progeny. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis of the existence of a new hybrid spot offshore of Brazil’s northeastern coast. The Abrolhos Archipelago is surrounded by the largest and richest coral reefs in the South Atlantic and is known to be a nesting site for loggerhead turtles (Carettacaretta). In this study, we performed a multidisciplinary investigation into levels of hybridization in sea turtles and their reproductive output in the Abrolhos beaches. Genetic data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and six autosomal markers showed that there are first-generation hybrid females nesting in Abrolhos, resulting from crossings between hawksbill males (Eretmochelysimbricata) and loggerhead females, and backcrossed hatchlings from both parental species. The type and extent of hybridization were characterized using genomic data obtained with the 3RAD method, which confirmed backcrossing between F1 hybrids and loggerhead turtles. The reproductive output data of Abrolhos nests suggests a disadvantage of hybrids when compared to loggerheads. For the first time, we have shown the association between hybridization and low reproductive success, which may represent a threat to sea turtle conservation.

The rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which guarantees excellent impermeability to most fluids and gases, even under high pressures. Another phenomenon associated with rock salt is the process of self-healing. Taking advantage of these physical-chemical and structural properties of rock salt, caverns opened by dissolution in salt domes have been used for storage of hydrocarbons and other products. Considering the large regional thicknesses and continuity of rock salt overlying the presalt reservoirs, PETROBRAS is studying the strategy and technical and economic feasibility for the use of underground storage of natural gas and CO2 in salt caverns. Despite being a technology already dominated worldwide is unprecedented, the offshore application in deep and ultra-deep water.

A1649,"Nowadays no other region on earth is more threatened by natural hazards than coastal areas. However the increasing risk in this area is not just a climate extreme events’ result. Coasts are the places with highest concentration of people and values, thus impacts continue to increase as the values of coastal infrastructures continue to grow. Climate change aggravates chronic social vulnerabilities since social groups may be affected differently both by climate change as well as by risk management actions. Relationships between these groups are often characterized by inequality, with different perceptions, response, or adaptation modes to climate hazards. Misperception of these differences often leads to policies that deepen inequities and increase the vulnerability of the weakest groups. Population affected by climatic extreme events increases dramatically resulting in urgent adaptation intervention. We address the interdependence of risk perception and vulnerability of coastal communities and the relevance of ecosystem services for adaptation. We developed a methodology where risk analysis and communities’ risk perception are linked through key actions at strategic points of risk assessment: (i) initial interviews with qualified local informants to complete an inventory of ecosystem services, (ii) a social valuation of ecosystem services by local people, and (iii) assessment of stakeholders’ social vulnerability. This approach allows a truly socially weighted risk assessment to be validated in three sites: Valle de Itajai (Brazil), Estuary of Lagoa dos Patos (Brazil), and Laguna de Rocha (Uruguay).

Among macroalgae, 1 species of red seaweed from Australia (Vanvoorstia bennettiana) is listed as Extinct, 10 species (six red algae and four brown algae) are listed as Critically Endangered, 1 species of brown alga is listed as Endangered, and 4 species (three red algae and one brown alga) are listed as Vulnerable. The number of macroalgal species assessed and reported in the IUCN Red List is less than 1 per cent of the total number of species listed in the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). All 15 threatened species are endemic to the Galapagos Islands, and 47 species have been assessed as at a risk of extinction in the Mediterranean. This highlights the knowledge gap with regard to macroalgae. In terms of macroalgal endemism, Antarctica ranks highest, with 27 per cent endemics, followed by South America (22 per cent) and the Red Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (9 per cent). New techniques such as genomics have been developed for species identification and for elucidating phylogenetic relationships.

A1209,"Mapping and monitoring mangrove ecosystems is a crucial objective for tropical countries, particularly where human disturbance occurs and because of uncertainties associated with sea level and climatic fluctuation. In many tropical regions, such efforts have focused largely on the use of optical data despite low capture rates because of persistent cloud cover. Recognizing the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for providing cloud-free observations, this study investigated the use of JERS-1 SAR and ALOS PALSAR data, acquired in 1996 and 2008 respectively, for mapping the extent of mangroves along the Brazilian coastline, from east of the Amazon River mouth, Pará State, to the Bay of São José in Maranhão. For each year, an object-orientated classification of major land covers (mangrove, secondary vegetation, gallery and swamp forest, open water, intermittent lakes and bare areas) was performed with the resulting maps then compared to quantify change. Comparison with available ground truth data indicated a general accuracy in the 2008 image classification of all land covers of 96% (kappa = 90.6%, tau = 92.6%). Over the 12 year period, the area of mangrove increased by 718.6 km2 from 6705 m2 to 7423.60 km2, with 1931.0 km2; of expansion and 1213 km2 of erosion noted; 5493 km2 remained unchanged in extent. The general accuracy relating to changes in mangroves was 83.3% (Kappa 66.1%; tau 66.7%). The study confirmed that these mangroves constituted the largest continuous belt globally and were experiencing significant change because of the dynamic coastal environment and the influence of sedimentation from the Amazon River along the shoreline. The study recommends continued observations using combinations of SAR and optical data to establish trends in mangrove distributions and implications for provision of ecosystem services (e.g., fish/invertebrate nurseries, carbon storage and coastal protection).

B2526,"Economic activity Economic growth, measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, has steadily increased globally, although it has slowed as a result of declining trade volume. Growth in the first half of 2019 stood at 1 per cent, the weakest level since 2012 (IMF, 2019). Economic growth, when averaged across the global population (with vast geographical variability in economic growth, as noted in sect. 3), has resulted in the average annual income of an individual increasing from $3,300 in 1950 to $14,574 in 2016. The slowdown in growth is largely associated with weak manufacturing and trade. In contrast, service industries such as tourism have grown (IMF, 2019). As the global population has grown and the demand for goods and services has increased, there has been an associated increase in energy consumption and resource use. Understanding the relationship between increasing economic activity and the use of natural resources is essential to identifying future sustainability and limiting impacts associated with extraction, production, consumption and waste generation (Jackson, 2017). Total energy demand, as measured in million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), grew from 13,267 Mtoe in 2014 to 13,978 Mtoe in 2018. At the same time, primary energy intensity, an indicator of how much energy is used by the global economy, slowed from 1.7 per cent in 2017 to 1.2 per cent in 2019 (IEA, 2019a). The slowing of efficiencies (i.e., the amount of GDP generated for the amount of energy used) is the result of a number of short-term factors, such as growth in fossil fuel-based electricity generation, and longer-term structural changes, such as a slowing transition towards less energy-intensive industries. At the same time, investment targeting energy efficiencies has been stable since 2014. Improvements in technical efficiency reduced energy-related carbon emissions by 3.5 gigatons of CO2 between 2015 and 2018 (IEA, 2019a). In addition, renewable energy production has grown as many countries shift to energy strategies that rely on it as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean energy production is part of many strategic developments and grew from 1 TWh (Terawatt hour) in 2014 to 1.2 TWh in 2018 (IEA, 2019b). Changes in energy production, including marine renewable energy and the pressures generated on the marine environment, are detailed in chapters 19 and 21. Economic activity associated with the extraction of marine resources also continues to grow as the global population expands. Marine and freshwater food production was a key protein provider and source of income for approximately 59.6 million people globally in 2016, an increase from 56.6 million in 2014. Although marine capture fisheries remain stable at around 80 million tons, mariculture is steadily increasing, from 26.8 million tons in 2014 to 28.7 million tons in 2016 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018). The implications for increasing marine food production demands, including overfishing, bycatch of endangered species and habitat loss or degradation by fishing and aquaculture, are described in detail in chapters 15–17. Many countries are developing or have developed strategies for the potential growth of maritime activities, such as ocean energy, aquaculture, marine biotechnology, coastal tourism and seabed mining (i.e., growth of the blue economy). However, an important constraint on the growth of ocean economies is the current declining health of the ocean and the pressures already being placed on it (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2016), many of which are detailed in Part 5.
 ","How did the world energy demand vary during the period from 2014 to 2018?
 ","The world total energy demand grew from 13,267 Mtoe in 2014 to 13,978 Mtoe in 2018.

 ","Ocean's large mass and high heat capacity enable it to store more than 1000 times the energy found in the atmosphere, for the same increase in temperature. In fact, the ocean has absorbed almost 93% of the extra heat stored from other sources combined from 1971 and 2010.
 ","Algal blooms has economic effects on fishing and tourist industries, consequently reducing food supply for local human population.

B2055,"Changes in impact Coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation pose severe risks to coastal infrastructure, property, economic activities and ecological systems, and adaptation calls for significant investment. There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018). The projection for risk and damage associated with coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation indicates that they are likely to increase in the future (Dunn and others, 2019). Ecosystem impacts from coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation can be substantial, in particular if there is a transformation from long-term accretion to erosion. Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b). Major socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density. Existing problems have been identified adjacent to the Ganges, Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, Volta and Mississippi river deltas. For other parts of the coast, the management of erosion hazards through the use of engineering interventions requires longterm commitments to maintenance, including the cost of upgrading coastal defensive works, with potential risk to human safety and livelihoods if defences are subject to decline. Local sea level rise and storminess vary significantly between regions. Based on long-term satellite data, wave height shows an overall global increase (Young and Ribal, 2019), but large regional differences are reported, from large changes in the Southern Ocean to negligible effects in the North Sea (De Winter and others, 2012). Such spatial variations are likely to result in regional variations in erosion and sedimentation (Brown and others, 2016).

B2399,"Environmental impacts Offshore oil and gas exploration and development practices have evolved significantly in terms of minimizing impacts on the surrounding environment, but operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts still occur. Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures. Produced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels. Most of the increase is expected from offshore oil and gas production (IFP Énergies Nouvelles, 2011). Disposal options include injection into the same formation from where the oil is produced, treating the produced water to meet a certain quality standard and then either discharging it into the environment or using treated water in oil and gas field operations. While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019). Although the funded projects focus on landbased drilling, many advances will be relevant to offshore oil and gas production. The emission of criteria pollutants related to platform or non-platform sources can have an impact on air quality in the vicinity of the drilling and production platforms. Platform sources comprise emissions from on-board equipment, such as boilers, natural gas engines and pneumatic pumps, while non-platform sources comprise emissions from pipe-laying operations, support and survey vessels and helicopters. In addition, open flaring of unwanted or excess gas from production platforms affects air quality.

In the last few years, many oil and gas fields have reached the end of their productive lives and many platform structures are reaching, or already exceeding, their project service life, 20 to 30 years on average. In addition, changes acting on the global market and the recent sharp fall in oil price are inducing oil companies to re-estimate the profitability of each production unit and to consider, in several cases, decommissioning as a valid alternative. This paper aims at analyzing the future demand for decommissioning of fixed offshore units, taking into account the financial, technical and operational point of view. Forecast of decommissioning demand is finally mapped in the short, medium and long terms.

A1473,"Overfishing is a concerning threat that can lead to the collapse of fish stocks. We assessed the combinations of factors, including biological traits, types of exploitation and responses to sea temperature and salinity changes, that drive species to collapse in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) tropical and subtropical regions. We applied a catch-based method of stock classification and a catch time series of 61 years from 132 exploited fish species. Species were categorized as Collapsed, Overexploited, Fully Exploited or in Development, and we used a GAM analysis to understand their categorization over time. Furthermore, a Redundancy Analysis was developed to assess the species characteristics that best predicted each exploitation category. Twelve species were classified as Collapsed, 55 as Overexploited, 46 as Fully Exploited and 19 as in Development. Tropical and subtropical exploited species collapses in Brazil were best explained by a complex combination of a negative impact of warmer sea temperatures, fishery exploitation and specific life-history traits. A synergistic interaction between these factors could bring species to collapse. We hypothesize that the exploitation of species with vulnerable traits may alter how these species respond to temperature and, therefore, lead them to collapse given that intense exploitation may affect their ability to respond to temperature increases. Measures to mitigate climate change impacts should take into consideration incentives to decrease the exploitation of vulnerable species and, specifically, consider species with more sensitive biological traits. Such measures are also important to minimize the socioeconomic impacts on the people that depend on these species.

A376,"Fish fauna was studied in five sites of the shallow infralittoral of the Paranaguá Bay during the period from October 1999 to September 2000. At each sampling site, fish were sampled with other trawls, salinity and temperature were measured, water samples were taken from the bottom of the water column for determination of dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. The spatial and temporal behavior of the environmental variables was analyzed by a Principal Component Analysis; Cluster Analysis was used to gather the sampling sites, and Factorial Correspondence Analysis was applied to the most abundant species. Temperature was the most important variable for the distribution of the months, allowing the division of the study period into hot and cold months. The temporal variation in the fish fauna composition was indicated by cluster analysis, with highest percentages of dissimilarity between the sampling sites during hot months. The variation in dissimilarity between the sites occurred due to differences in the number of individuals and species of the catches. The high frequencies of occurrence of Anisotremus surinamensis, Etropus crossotus, Genidens genidens, Micropogonias furnieri and Sphoeroides greeleyi were related to high temperatures.

Although available an extensive literature describing its fundamental issues, these vortex-induced phenomena still deserve investigation, particularly in the offshore platforms installed in regions with high current speed. Recently, the Vortex-Induced Motions - VIM, a particular case of vortex-induced vibration with high magnitude of response amplitude, have been observed in SPAR platforms installed in Gulf of Mexico - GoM, opening a new investigation field. For those motions, aspects such as asymmetric mooring restoring stiffness and the probable three-dimensionality of the flow turn the problem even more complex. Since 2003, in partnership with University of Sao Paulo and consultant companies, PETROBRAS has been studying the use of monocolumn floaters for oil production in Campos Basin and GoM. Considering the environmental conditions in these areas and assuming that monocolumn floaters can exhibit similar VIM behavior of SPAR platforms, it was started an experimental investigation focusing on VIM responses of small-scale monocolumn floaters in towing tank. Although based on the state of art procedures used for SPAR platforms, the monocolumn experiments considered the different geometry of this concept and the larger susceptibility to the three-dimensional effects, due to the smaller relation draft/beam. Special attention was given to the ratio roughness/beam in order to guarantee similarity between the experiments and its respective real cases. Additionally, different heading conditions were also tested. Thus, the present work presents a set of preliminary results and discussions concerning VIM of monocolumn floaters and its impact on the mooring line design and riser specification.

Hamworthy delivered an onboard vaporizer system to be installed on the 145,000 cu m LNG shuttle regasification vessel (SRV) Suez Neptune. SRV are designed to transport and store LNG, and then vaporize it into natural gas that can be sent ashore by subsea pipeline. Hamworthy is supplying three regasification skids per ship. Each shipset will have a regasification capacity of 210 ton/hr of LNG with a send-out pressure of 115 bar. The firm's second project comprises plant for a 138,000 cu m LNG floating storage and regasification unit, Golar Winter.

A680,"After the boom of converted floating, production, storage and offloading systems, based on the old VLCC design, many engineering institutes started thinking about optimum dimension for new units. However, these new FPSOs designs carried out worldwide concerns about good seakeeping behavior when considering general weather conditions, in order to apply their project to different locations around the globe. Analyzing the Brazilian specific conditions, it was verified that, considering waves, current and wind characteristics, the dimension proportions found in the projected units were not the best options, mostly because of the swell waves influence. Thus, in a cooperative project between University of Sao Paulo and PETROBRAS, the best dimensions for a specific case were studied, based on real premises from Campos Basin. During the study, the roll motion, which usually creates operational limits during hard environmental conditions, was focused. It was possible not only to evaluate the best breath and draught relations, but also the inclusion of a structured skirt in the ship bilge. The influence of different shapes in the ship's bow and stern were also evaluated, showing interesting results regarding the forces applied on the vessel. All the analyses were conducted considering numerical analysis, and the final dimensions were applied to a scaled model, which allowed to verify the real behavior of the projected unit in a test basin. As a conclusion, it was possible to define an optimized hull for the PETROBRAS premises, giving them a real design to be used in future explorations.

This mapping is pioneer at this region and was part of Águas Rasas Norte Project, conducted by research lab GeoRioeMar of Universidade Federal de Sergipe in partnership with PETROBRAS/CENPES, in the context of MARSEAL Project - Environmental Characterization of Sergipe and Alagoas Basin. The seismic profiles were performed by the sub-bottom profiler Edgetech 3200-XS associated with the control of collected samples. Although the interpretation of geophysical profiles have been carried out with the data without post-processing, it was possible to identify distinct reflectors and features such as reefs, carbonate banks, channels and canyons, beyond the thickness and variance of the acoustic response of distinct near-surface sediments. This preliminary characterization makes more viable seismic studies in detail about the several features and refinement of boundaries between near-surface sediments of the continental shelf of Sergipe-Alagoas.

B2014,"Ocean warming and land ice melt are the main causes of present-day accelerating global mean sea level rise. The global mean sea level has been rising since 1993 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with a clear superimposed acceleration of approximately 0.1 mm per year. Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions. Owing to global warming, many circulation systems also experience changes. Changes in sea level height, measured with high-precision satellite altimetry, hint at the widening and strengthening of the subtropical gyres in the North and South Pacific. The studies, furthermore, show a poleward movement of many ocean currents, including the Antarctic circumpolar current and the subtropical gyres in the southern hemisphere, as well as western boundary currents in all ocean basins. One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future. Impacts that follow such changes include regional sea level rise, changes in nutrient distribution and carbon uptake and feedbacks with the atmosphere. The globally averaged ocean surface temperature data show a warming of 0.62±0.12?°C per century over the period 1900– 2018. In the recent decade (2009–2018), the rate of ocean surface warming is 2.56±0.68?°C c-1. The warming happens in most ocean regions with some areas, such as in the North Atlantic, showing long-term cooling. Since 1955, the upper 2,000 m of the ocean has also exhibited signs of robust warming, as evidenced by the increase in ocean heat content. The spatial patterns of multidecadal salinity changes provide convincing evidence of global-scale water cycle change in the global ocean coincident with warming over the period. The resolved changes are replicated in all observed analyses of long-term salinity changes, and more recently have been reproduced in forced climate model simulations. Those changes are manifested in enhanced salinities in the near-surface, high-salinity subtropical regions and corresponding freshening in the low-salinity regions such as the West Pacific Warm Pool and the poles. Similar changes are also seen in the ocean subsurface, with similar patterns of freshening low-salinity waters and enhanced high-salinity waters represented in each of the ocean basins, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian, and across the Southern Ocean.

A1657,"We describe the design, implementation, and performance of a fully automated Santos Operational Forecasting System (SOFS), built to monitor and predict short-term (< 3 days) sea surface elevations, currents, temperature, and salinity in the Santos-Sao Vicente-Bertioga Estuarine System (SSVBES). The SSVBES located at 24.0∘S, 46.3∘W is a complex estuarine system with many interconnected channels and two connections with the open sea. The system is prone to storm tides that bring coastal flooding to and interrupt ship traffic through Santos Port. The SOFS hydrodynamic module is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) version POM-rain. The SSVBES model grid is forced by tides, winds, and river runoff and is nested into a coarse-resolution South Brazil Bight (SBB) grid. The SBB grid is forced by winds, density gradients, and the Brazil Current flowing offshore. Within SSVBES, SOFS works in parallel with three real-time observation stations. The model performance was tested against observed data with a best Willmott skill of 0.97 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 13.0 cm for tidal sea level (15.9% of the mean tidal range). For tidal currents, the best skill and RMSE were above 0.99 and 3.9 cm/s (4.3% of the mean tidal current range), respectively. The coupled system was able to simulate seven storm tides with average skill of 0.95 and average RMSE of 17.0 cm.

B2374,"Offshore hydrocarbon technologies for survey and exploration Oil and gas survey and exploration techniques locate hydrocarbon resources accumulated under impermeable rock formations. An initial assessment using seismic surveys evaluates the location of hydrocarbon-rich geologic plays (a group of oil- and gas-bearing rocks) that share a common history of hydrocarbon generation, migration and entrapment (Maloney, 2018; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2017). This sets the stage for geological and geophysical surveys to obtain refined data on resource-bearing geological formations. Such surveys also provide an assessment of marine mineral, archaeological and benthic resources and any artificial structures buried and abandoned on the ocean floor. Offshore seismic surveys use specialized vessels equipped with a combination of air guns and other acoustic sources. The equipment also includes hydrophones attached to a set of cables (streamers) towed behind the vessel. The acoustic sources produce a seismic pulse projected toward the ocean floor that reflects off the boundaries between various layers of rock. The reflected pulse is then recorded by the hydrophones and collected for analysis. Recent advances in supercomputing and full waveform inversion technology are transforming resource estimation. Full waveform inversion, a new kind of processing technique applied to existing seismic data using supercomputers, creates a model of the subsurface rock layers in rich detail (Stratas Advisors, 2019). Similarly, advances in four-dimensional seismic technology, coupled with superior computing power, now provide new insights into hydrocarbon reservoir characteristics, thus offering greater certainty to prospective resource developers.

A1279,"The objective of this article is to evaluate the spatial distribution and quantify the Permanent Preservation Areas in the outfall estuarine of the Apodi-Mossoró River, in Rio Grande do Norte (Northeastern Brazil), for the years 1965 and 2012 according to the environmental legislation. In this way, it was possible to compare projected zoning changes on land use/landcover, as well as implications for wetlands. The methodology involved the reconstruction of scenarios based on norms and evaluation of thematic maps generated from remote sensing products. Digital Image Processing techniques were used to map land use/land cover categories and to identify the boundaries of protected areas in each period. The largest change observed indicates loss of 1,907.09 ha of flooded areas of the fluvial-marine plain, almost totally occupied by salt evaporation tanks. In 1965, three categories of PPA were observed, accounting for 455.17 ha, but for law limitations only 83.45 ha were protected. In relation to 2012, six categories of PPA were detected, totaling 1,051.96 ha, as a consequence of the expansion of protective areas, but the previously consolidated areas reduced to 787.57 ha the size of protected areas in the last period.

A1726,"This work reports the chemical monitoring of saline water and sediments at Aratu port, All Saints Bay, Brazil, when subjected to a deep dragging process (DDP) over a 2-year period (2010–2012). The aim of this work was to detect which metals had possible deleterious effects on the biota. It analyzed percentage of silt + clay and TOC and metal concentrations (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) before, during, and after the DDP. The determination of metal concentration in sediments used the following techniques: atomic absorption spectrometer with flame, also with hydrate generation, and cold vapor spectrophotometry. The DDP disturbed the concentrations of metals in sediments and water, but 15 months after the DDP, only Cu and Zn were detectable on the bottom saline water, and 20 months after the DDP, only Zn was detectable in water. This fact indicates that these metals were longer available for absorption by the marine biota with probable deleterious effect. Indeed, studies by others during the DDP in Aratu port, indicated the decrease from 50 to 40 of the number of microalgae species identified. On the other hand, in the sediments, 20 months after the DDP, the concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Hg, returned to the original values, but Ni and Zn did not return to their original values. Comparison with studies by others indicated that the sediments from dredging were inappropriate for disposal at sea.

B2247,"Invasion by non-indigenous species (NIS) is a major driver of biodiversity change that can reduce biodiversity, alter community structure and function, diminish fisheries and aquaculture production and impact human health and well-being. It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems. NIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).
 ","What forms of degradation of marine ecosystems can benefit non-indigenous species?
 ","Non-indigenous species are those that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier and become established in a biogeographical area outside their native range.
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio).

A1464,"Continental shelves are areas of extreme environmental and economic importance and priority areas for management and planning efforts. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding many tropical shelves, mainly due to high costs associated with surveying large marine areas with traditional techniques. Carbonatic, sediment-starved shelves are distributed across tropical and temperate regions and display characteristics that may allow the application of remote sensing methods, albeit the depth range found in these areas. Thus, this study tested the applicability of Landsat-8 imagery to detect bottom features in a sediment-starved shelf in North-eastern Brazil. The Brazilian Northeast Continental Shelf harbours a variety of geohabitats, including coral and algal reefs, beachrocks, mesophotic reefs, canyons, and paleochannels. Nine scenes were processed following the same steps: radiometric and atmospheric correction, masking, glint removal, water column correction and individual image adjustments. Two scenes were deemed best to portray targeted features. We detected 14 paleochannels in a 9700 km2 area, as well as the shelf break. A pixel-by-pixel analysis using all available bathymetric field data (n = 42,373 pixels) showed that 92.38% of the pixels were accurately classified. Misinterpreted pixels were either due to bordering regions incorrectly identified as paleochannels (3.99%) or paleochannels’ sections undetected in our final mosaic (3.62%). The final mosaic allowed a detailed view of submerged valleys (including previously unmapped channels) distributed up to areas deeper than 100 m using free of charge, medium-resolution satellite imagery. Some of these channels are known fishing grounds and fish spawning aggregation areas, making them priority zones for management and conservation efforts. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study applying Landsat imagery to map paleochannels in submerged areas, and most importantly, in areas deeper than 30 m. We believe this research can help focusing future mapping efforts and may advance the general knowledge of the area.

Such surveys also provide an assessment of marine mineral, archaeological and benthic resources and any artificial structures buried and abandoned on the ocean floor. Offshore seismic surveys use specialized vessels equipped with a combination of air guns and other acoustic sources. The equipment also includes hydrophones attached to a set of cables (streamers) towed behind the vessel. The acoustic sources produce a seismic pulse projected toward the ocean floor that reflects off the boundaries between various layers of rock. The reflected pulse is then recorded by the hydrophones and collected for analysis. Recent advances in supercomputing and full waveform inversion technology are transforming resource estimation. Full waveform inversion, a new kind of processing technique applied to existing seismic data using supercomputers, creates a model of the subsurface rock layers in rich detail (Stratas Advisors, 2019). Similarly, advances in four-dimensional seismic technology, coupled with superior computing power, now provide new insights into hydrocarbon reservoir characteristics, thus offering greater certainty to prospective resource developers.

B1982,"A new digital, global seafloor geomorphic features map has been built (especially to assist the World Ocean Assessment) using a combination of manual and ArcGIS methods based on the analysis and interpretation of the latest global bathymetry grid (Harris et al., 2014; Figure 1). The new map includes global spatial data layers for 29 categories of geomorphic features, defined by the International Hydrographic Organization and other authoritative sources. The new map shows the way in which the ocean consists of four main basins (the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean) between the tectonic plates that form the continents. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).

This established a record for the Brazilian state oil company in jacket installation. The structure is located in 142-m water in Campos Basin. In establishing this record, the piles were driven to maximum penetration of 110 m. The jacket, designed by Interconsult (Micoperi), presented a new concept for steel jackets using vertical external skirt piles. The concept eliminated the need for pile guides and enabled the 160-m-long piles to be installed and driven in a single piece. This permitted fast installation in an area of the open South Atlantic subject to severe seas of long period swells almost the entire year. The concept also reduces both overall weight and fabrication time.

A390,"Due to advances in the development of technology for distributed or small-scale gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology, a much more flexible and economical option for capturing associated gas, both on- and offshore - in the form of modular GTL technologies - is approaching. These systems are designed to operate efficiently and economically when producing ∼ 500 bpd. UK-based company CompactGTL plc and Velocys are developing modular solutions that combine steam methane reforming (SMR) and Fischer Tropsch (FT), and both have found ways to reduce the size of the hardware. In the integrated two-stage system developed by CompactGTL, which is designed to incorporate modules weighing < 25 ton and producing 200 bpd of liquids per module, the SMR and FT reactions are carried out in a series of mini-channels. In contrast, the Velocys combined SMR/FT system for offshore GTL takes advantage of microchannel reactor technology to shrink the hardware and intensify the processes even further. Both the CompactGTL and Velocys technologies have reached the trial stage. CompactGTL entered into a joint development testing agreement in 2006 with Petrobras to deliver a 20 bpd pilot plant to be tested onshore at the Petrobras Aracaju site in Brazil. While, in March 2010, Velocys entered into a joint demonstration and testing agreement with offshore facility developer Modec, Toyo Engineering, and Petrobras, to build and operate a 5-10 bpd microchannel GTL demonstration plant at the Petrobras facility in Fortaleza, Brazil. The trials being undertaken by CompactGTL and Velocys suggest that it may well be possible to reap the advantages of small-scale GTL sooner rather than later.

A395,"Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil. The recently created Petrobras Heavy Oil Technological Program - PROPES - is in charge of the development, together with universities, service companies and the industry, of new technologies for the offshore heavy oil fields. The main objective of all this work is to set the basis for the economical development of the significant volumes of heavy oil already discovered offshore Brazil.

A172,"Fish fauna was studied in five sites of the shallow infralittoral of the Paranaguá Bay during the period from October 1999 to September 2000. At each sampling site, fish were sampled with other trawls, salinity and temperature were measured, water samples were taken from the bottom of the water column for determination of dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. The spatial and temporal behavior of the environmental variables was analyzed by a Principal Component Analysis; Cluster Analysis was used to gather the sampling sites, and Factorial Correspondence Analysis was applied to the most abundant species. Temperature was the most important variable for the distribution of the months, allowing the division of the study period into hot and cold months. The temporal variation in the fish fauna composition was indicated by cluster analysis, with highest percentages of dissimilarity between the sampling sites during hot months. The variation in dissimilarity between the sites occurred due to differences in the number of individuals and species of the catches. The high frequencies of occurrence of Anisotremus surinamensis, Etropus crossotus, Genidens genidens, Micropogonias furnieri and Sphoeroides greeleyi were related to high temperatures. The greatest number of fish and species observed in hot months may be related to the life cycle of many species, which reproduce in warmer months, and whose offspring use estuaries as breeding areas.

A1165,"The Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC), Offshore Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario, posing great development challenges. The microbial carbonate reservoir is unusual regarding its origin and petrophysical properties; the fluids have a variable CO2 content; the few analogue reservoirs around the world do not compare in terms of volumes, water depth and distance to the coast; and there are also flow assurance issues. Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots. The current Petrobras Business Plan (2011-15) foresees mat the SBPSC areas alone will produce over 500,000 boe/d in 2015 and over 1,100,000 boe/d in 2020. These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account. On the other hand, when is it better to pay for extra flexibilities, accepting the inevitable CAPEX increase? Some examples would be: smart completions and possibility to inject different chemical products in the wells; gas and water separated lines for each satellite injector; flexible subsea layout, allowing multiples strategies and the addition of more wells; FPSO plants designed to inject desulphated water, or to export, import or reinject me gas, and also to separate variable CO2 contents in the produced fluids. This paper aims to discuss the influence of the main subsurface uncertainties in the selection of alternatives to develop the giant fields in the SBPSC, in a fast track way.

The seismic surveys reveal the widespread distribution of incised valleys of different size in offshore continuation of the present-day Parnaiba delta. According to morphology two channel types can be distinguished: U-shaped channels in the eastern part and V-shaped channels in the western part. The stratigraphic successions were grouped into four seismic units separated by different seismic boundaries. The characteristics of the seismic boundaries and internal reflectors of the seismic units were used to distinguish between marine and riverine deposits. The incised-valleys architectural elements were used to link sedimentation processes and variations in base level from late Pleistocene channel avulsion and channel infill in the lowermost course of the paleo-Parnaíba River to marine sediments of the present-day inner shelf.

A512,"Renewable energies as an additional source have become vital in modern societies. The search for alternative energy sources has led the scientific community to the oceans, demanding a shift in energetic policies, which must be redefined to favor the development of renewable energy technologies at sea. The goal is to generate electric energy while producing less pollutants or even while using the outputs of human anthropic activities as input for the generation of energy, food, products and for the mitigation of climate change impacts. The present study focus on the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) technology, which presents the greatest potential for energy exploitation from the oceans and which generates a range of by-products. The South Atlantic Ocean presents the potential to support OTEC plants, with emphasis on the region called Brazilian Ocean Thermal Energy Park, with a total coverage area of 1,893,000.00 km2 and an operating potential of up to 376 OTEC plants. Results of this work indicate that the park operation in maximum capacity can generate energy at a nominal power of 41.36 GW, and remove 60.16 GW or 60.16 GJ/s of ocean heat and 8.13 kg/s or 256.37 Tg/year of atmospheric CO2.

B2220,"Coastal population and size of coastal communities Although there have been calls for regular monitoring and assessment of the process of change in coastal areas (see, for example, Shi and Singh, 2003), they have largely been at the national or regional levels. Little, if anything, has been published about the total global coastal population since the early 2000s. Because of the significance of the impacts of sea level rise, studies since then have concentrated, in particular, on low-elevation coastal zones, which have a narrower scope (for example, Neumann and others, 2015). Studies in the early 2000s showed that, globally, there is a major concentration of population in the coastal zones. Figure I is based on the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population count grids for 2010 (Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), 2011). The project uses night-time satellite data of observed light sources to identify urban areas and reallocates census count data within administrative boundaries. The resulting map (figure I) shows that the global coastal population is concentrated mostly in East, South-East and South Asia. The evidence suggests that concentration in the coastal zone is increasing as a proportion of the total global population (Merkens and others, 2016). Nevertheless, access to the ocean, in particular for maritime transport, remains important for landlocked States. Urban areas near the coast reinforce the concentration: 40 per cent of the population within 100 km of the coast lives in 4 per cent of the land area within that distance (Small and Nicholls, 2003). Much of the concentration (about 90 per cent) is in coastal cities with populations of over 1 million. An analysis of such cities as recorded in The World’s Cities in 2018 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), 2018) is shown in table 1. The analysis thus shows that the main concentrations of urban coastal population are in East, South and South-East Asia, and that the most rapid rates of growth of such populations are in those regions and sub-Saharan Africa. At the other end of the scale are tens of thousands of smaller coastal communities around the world. The number of, and populations in, such communities are unknown. It seems likely, however, that the number of such communities along the coasts of the world is high, and that official local government units often contain many more than one community. For example, in Nova Scotia, Canada, a recent assessment indicates that, while there are about 50 official municipalities, there are approximately 1,000 separate coastal communities (Charles, 2020). Accordingly, there is great diversity among coastal communities across the globe, notably in differences between the big cities noted above and rural communities, where such economic activities as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and tourism are typically prominent. Whatever the size of the community, it often plays a role in stewardship of the coast. Indeed, the role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly recognized and valued, in terms of many local initiatives in ocean conservation, around the world, that often succeed both in improving livelihoods and protecting communities (Charles, 2017; Charles and others, 2020). The role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly valued. Many coastal communities around the world and their smallscale fishers have undertaken a large number of local initiatives in ocean conservation, often with considerable success. The successes of those communities are often based on local knowledge, structures and cooperation (Charles, 2017). The vulnerability of coastal communities to the impacts of climate change is of increasing concern. It is relevant to the planning of tourism development, in particular in small island developing States with economies that are dependent on tourism, and fisheries management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that, under current trends of the increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change, the risks of erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization and cascading impacts owing to mean sea level rise and extreme weather events, among others, are projected to increase significantly throughout the present century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019). Coastal communities located in the Arctic, in low-lying (often deltaic) States, such as Bangladesh and Guyana, in paths frequented by cyclones or hurricanes and in densely populated megacities are especially vulnerable. On the other hand, there appear to be health benefits from living in the coastal zone (see chap. 8B on human health as affected by the ocean). Small coastal communities are not just physically vulnerable to climate change impacts; they are also socially vulnerable, in particular in rural areas (Charles and others, 2019). Rural coastal communities are vulnerable to weather events and flooding as a result of geographic location and limited access to health care, goods, transportation and other services. Sensitivity to market fluctuations from their dependence on natural resources, and poverty, limited economic opportunities and losses of populations, create problems when trying to adapt (Armitage and Tam, 2007; Amundsen, 2015; Bennett and others, 2016; Metcalf and others, 2015; May, 2019c). Such factors strain material assets, as well as the social and moral foundations that facilitate collective problem-solving (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019a). Communities are more likely to mobilize collective resources in response to threats when people actively care about each other and the place they live (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019b; Wilkinson, 1991). That may be a function of attachment to the history, culture or environmental context of a place and/or the people in a place. Those attachments can become potential sources of resistance to change in contexts of low social diversity and slow population change, or the basis for conflict in contexts of high social diversity and fast population change (Graham and others, 2018; May, 2019b, 2019c). The combined effect of physical and social vulnerability on community capacities is particularly challenging at a time when collective action efforts for mitigation and adaptation are more important than ever (May, 2019b, 2019c). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, for our most vulnerable communities, many of which are coastal, transformative mitigation and adaptation is necessary to assuage the worst impacts of climate change. Incremental change is no longer seen as a possibility by most States: more radical action is thought to be needed to reduce the impacts of and adapt to a changing climate. Responses to threats from climate change are varied and include a mix of hard and soft coastal defences. Built infrastructure, such as sea walls or dykes, is widely used but tends to be more costly and maintenance-dependent than ecosystem-based measures, such as marshes, mangroves, reefs or seagrass (see also sect. 7.3). Having limited data inhibits estimates of the cost effectiveness of both hard and soft measures, especially across geographies and scales (Oppenheimer and others, 2019), although State-level estimates exist (see, for example, Environment Agency of the United Kingdom, 2015). The World Bank estimated that, without concrete climate and development action, over 143 million people could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Rigaud and others, 2018). To address those problems, in coastal areas, integrated coastal zone management is widely regarded as an effective approach to climate change and other drivers (Nicholls and Klein, 2005; Nicholls and others, 2007; see also chap. 27 on management approaches).
 ","Why are small rural coastal communities so vulnerable to climate change impacts?
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio). In addition, there is some evidence related to the increase of some harmful algal species related to climate warming in some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016).
 ","Coastal areas
 ","With the increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified coastlines, there is a high risk of ecological disturbance to organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nursery purposes, which also reduces the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone.

A1249,"Along moderate to high-energy sandy coasts of the world, periods of accretion are often punctuated by episodes of erosion and retreat. However documenting the legacy of such events in sand-dominated sequences remains a challenge. The present-day moderate-relief coastlines of Camboriú Peninsula (CP) and the adjacent Navegantes coastal plain in Santa Catarina, Brazil, exhibit a variety of geological features related to recent intense storms, such as the Santa Catarina cyclone of record (March 2004) and subsequent events. These systems offer an opportunity to assess the use of modern indicators of storm erosion as a guide to reconstructing their counterparts from the sedimentary record. The 0.5-2.0-km-long, headland-segmented, coarse-grained, reflective beaches of the Camboriú Peninsula contrast with a 10-km-long, fine-grained, dissipative beach of the Navegantes plain. Morphological indicators of erosion include steep dune and berm scarps, as well as ephemeral washout channels produced by rainfall-induced runoff. Where modified by subsequent deposition, these features can still be identified by their diagnostic reflection geometries and variable-angle truncations (disconformities) in highresolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images. In addition to morphological indicators of erosion, coastal sedimentary sequences contain distinct lithological anomalies. Heavy-mineral concentrations (HMCs) are easily identifiable in sediment cores and trenches and produce strong reflections on GPR images. Along Estaleiro Beach (CP), a buried disconformity was identified in GPR images beneath a road, approximately 25 m landward of the November 2004 storm scarp. Its geometry is similar to the recent scarp and its strong geophysical signal return is due to a magnetite-enriched horizon at a depth of 2.6 m. At the Navegantes strandplain, patchy thin layers enriched in fine-grained heavy minerals are common on a gently sloping intertidal beach and near the base of foredunes. Moreover, in the landward portion of the plain that developed during the past 2,000 years, the presence of truncated tangential-oblique reflections in GPR records and HMCs reaching 10-30 cm in thickness indicates past reworking of beach and dune sediments by a series of intense erosional episodes. Low-field magnetic susceptibility measurements of vibracores indicate values from thick HMC layers exceeding 1,000 (*10 -5 SI) in contrast to 0-15 (*10 -5 SI) for background quartz-rich sands. Given the relatively constant background fraction of heavy minerals in beach sands, the thickness and degree of concentration in HMCs can be used as proxies for the relative impact of high-energy events, including their duration and magnitude. Despite the apparent low preservation potential of these features on high-energy coasts, post-storm accretion and rapid progradation increase their chances of being removed from wave action.

A1474,"We present new evidence for the existence of a large pockmark field on the continental slope of the Santos Basin, offshore southeast Brazil. A recent high-resolution multibeam bathymetric survey revealed 984 pockmarks across a smooth seabed at water depths of 300–700 m. Four patterns of pockmark arrays were identified in the data: linear, network, concentric, and radial. Interpretation of Two-dimensional multi-channel seismic reflection profiles that crosscut the surveyed area shows numerous salt diapirs in various stages of development (e.g. salt domes, walls, and anticlines). Some diapirs were exposed on the seafloor, whereas the tops of others (diapir heads) were situated several hundreds of meters below the surface. Extensional faults typically cap these diapirs and reach shallow depths beneath the seafloor. Our analysis suggests that these pockmark patterns are linked to stages in the development of underlying diapirs and their related faults. The latter may extend above salt walls, take the form of polygonal extensional faults along higher-level salt anticlines, or concentric faults above diapir heads that reach close to the seafloor. Seismic data also revealed buried pockmark fields that had repeatedly developed since the Middle Miocene. The close spatio-temporal connection between pockmark and diapir distribution identified here suggests that the pockmark field extends further across the Campos and Espírito Santo Basins, offshore Brazil. Spatial overlap between the pockmark field topping a large diapir field and a proliferous hydrocarbon basin is believed to have facilitated the escape of fluid/gas from the subsurface to the water column, which was enhanced by halokinesis. This provides a possible control on fossil gas contribution to the marine system over geological time.

The study addresses how domestic production may or may not leverage its business and promote sustainable growth of the national shipbuilding industry. The largest national power generation company, Petrobras, began a program in 2008 to renew the fleet of marine support. This program included the construction of 146 offshore support vessels in Brazilian shipyards. With this, the Brazilian government promoted the revitalization of the national shipbuilding industry by introducing this segment in its Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) and decided that shipbuilding should have local content in its production.

A773,"Improved sustainability performance in increasingly complex business environments is a challenging task for organizations operating in many different industries. In the offshore oil and gas industry, the use of potentially hazardous materials and operation under progressively hostile environments increases the risk of major accidents. Regulators have been trying to catch up on the design of regulatory frameworks that prevent these types of events, aiming to protect people, assets, and the environment. Although there are some recommended practices that companies have been using as the basis for their process safety management systems (PSMS), lack of uniformity and inefficient enforcement remain as two fundamental problems. This paper explores these two problems and takes some first steps toward a broader discussion about these important issues. We draw from the literature on sustainable operations to develop a descriptive case study of the offshore oil and gas industry by employing document analysis and an analysis of the Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) of Petrobras, a world leader energy company. By employing multiple primary and secondary data collection strategies, including a number of formal expert interviews, we map, explore and compare major recommended practices for PSMS, identify a series of gaps in policy and practice, and offer a number of recommendations and implications for practice, policy, and research.

In the offshore activity, in order to reduce the risks of capital intensive projects oil companies used cooperate entering into JV agreements. In addition, local content requirements and entry barriers in new markets, are some reasons to create partnerships between international and domestic companies. Brazil is not different. It is a market that has some challenges in which the cooperation with a local partner could reduce the risks for a foreign investor. In the oil companies' side, Petrobras is the target partner for an international oil company, because of its technical reputation and successful implementation of ultra-deep operations.

B2420,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Impacts of disturbance from noise Anthropogenic noise in the ocean increased in the last half of the past century. Commercial shipping is the main source, and the noise that it produces is often in frequency bands used by many marine mammals for communication. Many other types of marine biotas have also been shown to be affected by anthropogenic noise. Other significant sources of noise are seismic exploration for the offshore hydrocarbon industry and sonar. The impact of noise can be both to disrupt communication among animals and to displace them from their preferred breeding, nursery or feeding grounds, with consequent potential effects on their breeding success and survival. Impacts of recreational fishing Recreational fishing is a popular activity in many industrialized countries, in which up to 10 per cent of the adult population may participate. The impact of that type of fishing is only sometimes taken into account in fishery management, although the quantities caught can be significant for the management of stocks experiencing overfishing. In several countries, there is a substantial industry supporting the recreational catching of sport fish (including trophy fish, such as marlins, swordfish and sailfish), but catch statistics are generally not available.
 ","How much of the adult population engages in recreational fishing, in industrialized countries?
 ","Commercial transport has been the major contributor to anthropogenic noise.
 ","Some examples are maritime transport and oil exploration. They can displace animals and disrupt their communication.

In the context of Brazil, an example of this is tidal energy, which has a significant potential and is mainly concentrated on the coast of the States of Maranhão, Pará, and Amapá. However, only a few studies have been conducted to evaluate and take advantage of this energy source. One of the works in progress involves the study of a tidal power plant installation at the dam situated at Bacanga. This paper outlines and analyzes the configuration management of a tidal power plant, which is suited to the current physical conditions of the dam and complies with operational and physical constraints. In specific terms, the study takes account the reservoir operating restrictions and available physical space for installing turbines. A recent assessment has been carried out that involves bathymetry, high-resolution photos, and 3-D scanning to evaluate the potential value of the reservoir. This allowed a complete reservoir characterization and the designing of its digital model.

B2577,"Extreme climate events A tropical cyclone is the general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance that originates over the tropical ocean. Based on one-minute maximum sustained wind speed, the cyclonic disturbances are categorized into tropical depressions (? 17 m/s), tropical storms (18–32 m/s) and tropical cyclones (? 33 m/s, category 1 to category 5) (Knutson and others, 2010). A tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone, depending on geographic location. Anthropogenic climate change has increased precipitation, winds and extreme sea level events associated with a number of observed tropical cyclones. For example, studies have shown that the rainfall intensity of tropical cyclone (Hurricane) Harvey increased by at least 8 per cent (8–19 per cent) owing to climate change (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Van Oldenborgh and others, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). There is emerging evidence of a number of regional changes in tropical cyclone behaviour, such as an increase in the annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades, extremely severe tropical cyclones occurring in the Arabian Sea, cyclones making landfall in East and South-East Asia, an increase in frequency of moderately large storm surge events in the United States since 1923 and a decrease in frequency of severe tropical cyclones making landfall in eastern Australia since the late 1800s. There is low confidence that they represent detectable anthropogenic signals. Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and flooding, have increased in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean by about 1.0 cm per year and 0.8 cm per year over the period 1985–2018 (Young and Ribal, 2019). An increase in the average intensity of tropical cyclones, and the associated average precipitation rates, is projected for a 2°C global temperature rise, although there is low confidence in future frequency changes at the global scale (Yamada and others, 2017). Rising sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones in the future (Garner and others, 2017). Projections suggest that the proportion of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones will increase (Knutson and others, 2015; Park and others, 2017). Such changes will affect storm surge frequency and intensity, as well as coastal infrastructure and mortality. Investment in disaster risk reduction, flood management (ecosystem and engineered) and early warning systems decreases economic loss from tropical cyclones that occur near coasts and islands. However, such investments may be hindered by limited local capacities (e.g., ageing infrastructure and other non-climatic factors) that, for example, can lead to increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and storm surges in developing countries despite adaptation efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations affected by unprecedented storm trajectories. Management of risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity proves challenging because of the difficulties of early warning and its receptivity by affected populations.

A1096,"In 2004, after a cycle of 11 yr in which the annual increase in crude oil production was 8.6% avg, the production decreased 3%, according to Petrobras. In 2003, the production was 1.54 million bpd avg. The decline in production was due to delays in construction and the arrival of two Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels, the P-43 and P-48. The P-43 began to process crude oil on 12/22/2004. When the P-48 enters service, Petrobras will be able to increase its production of crude oil by 500,000 bpd. The P-43 is stationed in the Barracuda field, bay of Campos, offshore the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 800 m of water. Initial oil yield is 10,380 bpd of 25° gravity. Platform P-48, the twin of P-43, is part of the Barracuda-Caratinga project that will increase Petrobras crude oil production by 300,000 bpd. This platform will enter service in January 2005. With the new capacity, the production of crude oil by Petrobras is expected to reach 1.9 million bpd by the end of 2005. Other floating installations will contribute as well when they enter service, the P-50 and P-34. Petrobras is to invest $26,200 million until 2010 for E&P. Between 2005 and 2008, 17 installations will enter service allowing annual increases of 5.9% in production of crude oil and NGL, achieving self sufficiency in 2006. Petrobras has invested heavily in improved recovery that in the last 10 yr in the Marlim oilfield has yielded an additional increment of 3000 million bbl of crude oil. In November 2004 Petrobras gave a $47 million contract to the Western Geco company to make a three dimensional seismic study of the Marlim basin to identify reserves there. Discovery of an additional 290 million bbl of crude oil in Marlim is expected. On dry land, improved recovery enabled an increment of 200,000 bpd in production from the fields in the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe in 2004. In 2006-2007, the company expects to substitute for imports of light crude oil its own production to start in the oilfield offshore the state of Espírito Santo. This is lighter crude oil than that from the bay of Campos where the company now obtains 80% of its oil production. The Brazilian oilfields produce mainly heavy crude oil that has to be mixed with lighter imported crude oil to produce quality gasoline. However, Brazil increases its exports of heavy crude oil. The company is involved in new areas of exploration. They are discussed.

A164,"Aim: The disjunct distributions of freshwater organisms along coastal drainages are usually explained by palaeodrainages formed during sea-level retreats that connected currently isolated basins, or by river capture from tectonic adjustments between adjoining watersheds. We evaluate the relative importance of these events on the genetic variation of freshwater fishes inhabiting the Serra do Mar in eastern Brazil, a region with steep mountains and pronounced bays. Location: Coastal river drainages in southeastern Brazil. Taxon: Catfishes of the Trichomycterus alternatus group. Methods: We tested the effects of palaeolandscape connections (GIS-reconstructed palaeodrainages and putative river captures) on the genetic structure (mitochondrial and nuclear markers) of T. alternatus from 15 drainages using phylogenetic reconstructions, lineage delimitation methods and analyses of molecular variance. Results: Trichomycterus alternatus is monophyletic and comprised of three main lineages: two restricted to the basin at its northernmost distribution and another broadly distributed to the south. In the latter, seven major cytb clades were geographically compatible with the eight palaeodrainages, with three incongruences matching river captures previously described for the Guanabara Bay (GB). Shared haplotypes among isolated rivers flowing into GB provide the first molecular evidence of the ‘Rio de Janeiro’ palaeoriver. Main conclusions: Dispersal via palaeorivers is an important process, but it is not enough to recover the most recent dispersive events. Therefore, integrating both palaeo-riverine configuration (GIS-based) and localized river captures (geological studies) is crucial to reveal the role of past geological and climatic events on the distribution of freshwater organisms. Taken together, these two factors significantly explained a high portion T. alternatus genetic structure along coastal drainages, revealing a palaeolandscape scenario that may have been used by other freshwater Atlantic Forest taxa.

A811,"The Exploration and Production Department of Petrobras asked the R&D Center the development of a production system for 1800 m water depth, in Campos Basin, which would allow the installation of Steel Caterany Risers (SCR) in the starboard side of a production platform. The subsurface buoy concept was chosen as one of the alternatives. This concept has being developed since the preliminary studies conducted in the first phase of JIP Deepstar. This concept has an advantage of uncoupling the movements of the platform from the risers, reducing the loads due to the risers in the platform and allowing the installation of this system before the installation of the production vessel, anticipating the production of the field. This article shows the main characteristics of the buoy, its sizes, results of structural analyses and installation procedures for a buoy which sustains 14 SCR and 5 umbilicals in one side and 14 flexible jumpers and the same 5 umblicals in the opposite side. This concept was tested in two model test tanks, where it was verified that this concept is feasible. Also, information related to a field trial with a prototype installed in Brazilian waters will be presented.

A1177,"Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree. After being disassembled, the new subsea safety tree was inspected; the inspection showed minimal damage and erosion on the inside walls of the tool, indicating that the equipment would qualify for this type of offshore operation.

A1747,"Changes in the regional hydrodynamics of the region of the South Atlantic near the east coast of Brazil were evaluated from the beginning to the end of the century. The analysis was based on the anomalies from two downscaling experiments using the HadGEM2-ES outputs for the historical and RCP4.5 runs from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5. The anomalies between the experiments were collected in a system of two nested grids, with 1 / 3 ° and 1 / 12 ° horizontal resolutions. A northward displacement of the Brazil Current (BC), a southward BC transport intensification, and a 1.44 °C increase of the mean values of sea surface temperatures were observed. The sea level rise (SLR) was projected up until 2100 across the study area, and the spatial variations were shown to have an average on SLR rate of 7.30 mm year- 1 for those regions close to the coast. These results highlight the importance of studying climate change and applying methods to enable the evaluation of its effects on coastal zones, especially for regions with few existing studies, such as the Brazilian continental shelf area.

The system is based on a VLCC vessel, moored in DICAS (Differential Compliance Anchoring) system and presents a reasonably large riser porch on the portside for 77 lines. In this paper the dynamic behavior of the offshore system is evaluated using Dynasim, a time-domain simulation code for moored offshore systems, developed by the University of São Paulo and Petrobras. Simulations are compared with experimental results. Two kinds of tests were performed: ""Calibration"" tests were carried out in order to obtain static coefficients of the hull under isolated current and wind loads. ""Validation"" tests were conducted to evaluate the dynamic behavior under extreme environmental conditions combining current and wave excitation.

The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the region over which the respective coastal states hold sovereign rights for exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of natural, living or non-living, resources. The Brazilian EEZ has a rough oceanic area of 4.5 million square kilometers and is consecrated by the word ""Blue Amazon"", an area adjacent to the Brazilian mainland, which corresponds to 52% of the country's land area. Knowing the resources of such a large area is a strategic issue concerning the country's development. This work aims to determine the physical and geoacoustic properties (Vp, density, acoustic impedance) of polymetallic crusts from different areas along the Brazilian coast and to correlate with its chemical analysis. The first were measured in two different directions, parallel and orthogonal to the layering of the samples, in order to determine anisotropic effects related to the sample's framework. The correlation of the data will allow the analysis of the acoustic response of the samples to different frequencies indicating how the sample's chemical composition affects its acoustic response. Since the investigation of the seafloor is basically conducted using acoustic geophysical methods, the results of this research will allow deciding for the best procedure and technique to be used for future exploration of this resource.

A320,"Morphological features on low-latitude continental shelves have recorded past sea level fluctuations. This study aims to recognize and interrogate, on the Rio Grande do Norte (RN, NE Brazil) outer shelves, specific seabed morphologies that could have been produced by the punctuated relative sea level rise of the last deglaciation. These sea floor morphologies, imaged by single-beam bathymetric data from two areas of the North and East outer Shelves, ~ 160 km apart, reveal terraces, submerged paleo-shorelines, reefs, and incised valleys, which act as regional archives of past sea levels. The North and East outer shelves, covered by carbonate sediments, display steep gradients (~ 0.5°), variable widths (up to 13 km), and are bound between a well-defined shelf break at 75 m water depth and a beachrock ridge at 25 m. A steep step on the sea floor occurs between depths of 60 and 70 m in both areas. Though interrupted by the Açu Incised Valley, two distinct continuous terraces, 3 and 4 km in width, at depths of 49 m (± 5 m) (T1n) and 33 m (±3 m) (T2n), respectively, extend for 60 km along the North Shelf. Three nearly continuous terraces occur along the East Shelf on either the north or south sides of the Natal Canyon. A first, 6 km wide, lower terrace occurs at a depth of 54 m (± 4 m) (T1e). A second terrace, 2 km wide, at 40 m (± 2 m) (T2e), and a third 2 km wide upper terrace at 30 m (±2 m) (T3e) are also found. Patch reefs scattered over the terraces rise in average to 3 m in height. Based upon their depth occurrences, the established limited neotectonics in the study areas, and correlations with well-established archives from other morphological features of similar outer shelves, we hypothesize that these reefs and terraces were likely formed during the last deglacial interval spanning from the end of the MWP-1A (70–60 m), through the MWP-1B (50–40 m), and to subsequent punctuated millennial sea level rise events (30–25 m) occurring prior to the 8.2 kyr cooling event.

B2477,"Cargo traffic Until 2020, recovery of the world’s economy after 2011 has been reflected in the growth of world trade and, consequently, in the tonnage of cargo carried by international shipping (figure II). When the distances over which the cargoes were carried are taken into account, the growth in ton-miles is even larger (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 2019). Recovery is still in progress and has been seriously affected by the massive drop in world trade caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Such growth, however, has occurred against a weak competitive background for the international shipping industry. The economic crisis that took place from 2008 to 2011 occurred during a time when world shipping had commissioned a large increase in tonnage to meet the increased freight demand of the preceding years. The additional tonnage was delivered at a time when demand had started to reduce, with the result that, during the 2010s, the shipping industry was operating against a background of oversupply, which had the consequence of depressing freight rates. As measures to further control the pollutant emissions from ships take effect (from 2020), further pressures associated with implementing modifications to fleets will be placed on the shipping industry. To meet the new requirements (as detailed in chap. 11), ships must either purchase bunkers with a lower sulfur content (which may have a higher price, since the traditional ships’ bunkers have been the high-sulfur oils for which there was less demand) or retrofit scrubbers to clean the ships’ exhaust. Further economic pressures of that kind are described in chapter 11. The combined effect of continuing overcapacity and higher operating costs remains unclear (UNCTAD, 2019). For many years, the quantities of cargo loaded in ports in developing countries were smaller than those unloaded in those countries, marking an imbalance in seaborne trade. By the time of the first Assessment, the quantities, on average, were nearly in balance and, since then, the quantities loaded in developing countries now exceed those unloaded. Even excluding China, as the single largest developing country importer/exporter, there is still an excess of unloading in developing countries (UNCTAD, 2019). Containertraffic continues to be focused on the main East-West arteries across the northern hemisphere (Asia-Europe, trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic), which account for 40 per cent of all container shipping. Of the remaining 60 per cent, 27 per cent is intraregional, 13 per cent occurs across the other East-West routes in the northern hemisphere, 12 per cent is associated with traffic between southern hemisphere countries, and 8 per cent is associated with North-South traffic (UNCTAD, 2019). At the same time, there is a growing tendency to consolidate container shipping, so the combined market share of the top 10 container shipping lines increased from 68 per cent in 2014 to 90 per cent in 2019. That is combined with a returning interest in container shipping lines integrating their operations with traffic between originators and ports and between ports and the ultimate destinations. Those developments have the ability to undermine competition and thus to result in higher transit costs (UNCTAD, 2019). The total world fleet of ships carrying all that cargo amounted to 96,295 ships in early 2019, accounting for 1.97 billion dead-weight tons of capacity. Bulk carriers and oil tankers maintained the largest market shares of vessels that dominated the world fleet, at 42.6 per cent of all vessels and 28.7 per cent of dead-weight tons, respectively. A large proportion of the world’s tonnage continues to be registered in a relatively small number of registries. Nearly 70 per cent of the world’s tonnage is registered in seven registries: Panama (17 per cent), Marshall Islands (12 per cent), Liberia (12 per cent), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (10 per cent), Singapore (7 per cent), Malta (6 per cent) and China (5 per cent). No other registry is responsible for more than 4 per cent of the world’s tonnage (UNCTAD, 2019). Likewise, ownership and control of shipping continues to be concentrated in the hands of firms in a relatively small number of countries. In 2019, five economies accounted for more than 50 per cent of the world tonnage: Greece, Japan, China, Singapore and Hong Kong, China. Between 2015 and 2019, Greece, Singapore, China and Hong Kong, China have increased the proportion that they own/control (UNCTAD, 2019). The construction of new ships still remains very concentrated in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, which together represent 90 per cent of all cargo ship construction activity. The demolition of ships that have reached the end of their useful life likewise continues to be concentrated in the same countries as reported in the first Assessment. In 2018, 47.2 per cent of the total reported tonnage of propelled seagoing vessels of 100 gross tons and above that were sold for demolition were demolished in Bangladesh, 25.6 per cent in India, 21.5 per cent in Pakistan, 2.3 per cent in Turkey and 2 per cent in China, leaving 1.4 per cent for the rest of the world. The share of the market held by China, India and Turkey has been declining (UNCTAD, 2019). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been disrupting global trade extensively. Demand for the transport of raw materials and finished goods has dropped significantly, while demand for the transport of health-related goods has risen (United Nations Coordinating Committee on Statistical Activities (UNCCSA), 2020). Overall, cargo shipping activity has dropped significantly: for example, trade from the European Union to China and the United States dropped in the first 31 weeks of 2020 by 47 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, compared with 2019; trade in the reverse directions has dropped by 26 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively (European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), 2020).

A1829,"By monitoring the variation of weights of floating production units (FPUs), the sum of total weight computed by load calculators on board very often does not match the actual displacement based on the current drafts. Differences can also be observed in the trim and heel of FPUs, which present values different from zero degree in the calculations, but in fact they are frequently kept near zero by ballast control. The mooring lines and risers tensions are one of the most uncertain weight items in loading conditions reported by the crew on board, therefore, this paper aims to assess the influence and behavior of these systems to a variety of situations in which FPUs operate. Analyses were performed for semi-submersibles and FPSOs considering two configurations of mooring system: catenary and taut-leg. The purpose is to evaluate how the magnitude of the resulting force varies-and hence how the trim and heel change-for a range of offsets caused by environmental conditions. The effect of mooring lines and risers is also discussed regarding the water depth by means of case studies considering a range of water depths. Actual lines properties and seabed bathymetry from mooring system models of platforms located offshore Brazil have been taken as reference. In short, the mooring lines and risers loads will be calculated for different types of floating production units, mooring system configurations and water depths in order to evaluate their influence on the trim, heel and displacement of FPUs.

A1428,"In carbonate rock reservoirs, spatial distribution models and elastic properties are complex because of diagenetic processes and mineralogical composition, which together directly interfere with variations in pore shape and interconnectivity. The main objective of this paper is to propose a workflow to aid in three-dimensional quantitative carbonate reservoir characterization of the Quissamã Formation (Macaé Group) in the Pampo field of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. Model-based seismic inversion, sequential Gaussian simulation with cokriging for porosity modeling, and truncated Gaussian simulation with trend for facies modeling were used to characterize the carbonate reservoirs. Our results show that the carbonate platform is located between the upper Aptian and lower Albian seismic surfaces. Interpretation of a new surface, called the intra-Albian, was possible via acoustic-impedance (AI) analysis. Our workflow facilitated identification of low AI, high porosity, and best facies areas in structural highs where the most productive wells have been drilled. Facies modeling suggests that intercalation of facies with high and low porosities is connected to shallowing-upward cycles. Finally, several debris facies with low AI and high porosities were identified in an area that could be targeted for new exploration.

A1872,"Fatigue is one of the key governing conditions in the design of rigid risers, in particular those in ultra-deep water. One effective way of improving fatigue is to adopt a lazy wave configuration, rather than a simple catenary. Steel Lazy Wave Risers (SLWR) have been successfully used offshore Brazil (Hoffman et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2017) and in the Gulf of Mexico (Beattie et al. 2013), and have been considered for the North Sea (Felista et al. 2015) and offshore Australia (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2015). Yet, it is probably the most computational-intensive aspect of it. Fatigue analyses require a very large number of load cases to be run, on complex, non-linear models. Methods for simplifying aspects of the analysis are highly desirable, but they must be weighed to provide the required safety levels whilst not introducing uneconomical, overconservative assumptions. The top first weld is a crucial hotspot, in particular for production SLWRs (Senra et al. 2011). These typically adopt flexible joints (FJ) at the connection to the vessel/platform, and linearization of the FJ stiffness is one of these key simplifications that bring significant value in reducing analysis cost. This paper describes a method for estimating the characteristic angle used for the linearization, which results in significant stiffness reduction in contrast with the usual, simpler method. Non-linear FJ stiffness curves are usually available, and they provide stiffness associated to the FJ absolute angle. The FJ stiffness significantly reduces with the angle of rotation. The conventional method adopts the stiffness corresponding to the most likely riser angle - absolute value measured from the static configuration. Conversely, the proposed methodology for estimating the most likely change in angle. As the angles often turn up in alternate angles, the proposed method results in much higher characteristic angle, and hence much lower FJ stiffness. The outcome is significantly less conservative designs, whilst still meeting the same required safety margins.

B2259,"Impacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere Ocean circulation The intensified study of the ocean as part of the study of climate change has led to a much clearer understanding of the mechanisms of ocean circulation and its annual and decadal variations. As a result of changes in the heating of different parts of the ocean, patterns of variation in heat distribution across the ocean (such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation) are also changing. Those changes in patterns result in significant changes in weather patterns on land. Water masses are also moving differently in areas over continental shelves, with consequent effects on the distribution of species. There is evidence that the global circulation through the open ocean may also be changing, which might lead, over time, to reductions in the transfer of heat from the equatorial regions to the poles and into the ocean depths. Storms and other extreme weather events Increasing seawater temperatures provide more energy for storms that develop at sea. The scientific consensus is that this will lead to fewer but more intense tropical cyclones globally. Evidence exists that the observed expansion of the tropics since approximately 1979 is accompanied by a pronounced poleward migration of the latitude at which the maximum intensities of storms occur. This will certainly affect coastal areas that have not been exposed previously to the dangers caused by tropical cyclones. Ultraviolet radiation and the ozone layer The ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun in the UV-B range (280-315 nanometres wavelength) has a wide range of potentially harmful effects, including the inhibition of primary production by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and function of plankton communities and alterations of the nitrogen cycle. The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere blocks most UV-B from reaching the ocean’s surface. Consequently, stratospheric ozone depletion since the 1970s has been a concern. International action (under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) to address that depletion has been taken, and the situation appears to have stabilized, although with some variation from year to year. Given those developments and the variations in the water depths to which UV-B penetrates, a consensus on the magnitude of the ozone-depletion effect on net primary production and nutrient cycling has yet to be reached. There is, however, a potential effect of ultraviolet on nanoparticles.

A1136,"In order to comply with ANP / INMETRO No. 1 regulations, Petrobras undertook a project to install fiscal flow meters on its gas pipelines located on its Marlin Asset platforms in the Campos Basin. However, meter installation required 15 days of shutdown on each platform, which would reduce production rates. A technology was needed to minimize shutdown time and maximize revenues; Petrobras selected Hot Tapping and Plugging with a Bypass arrangement. Hot Tapping and Plugging with Bypass procedures isolates a section of the pipe through the installation of temporary STOPPLES that are inserted into the pipe through hot taps made on in-line welded fittings. Using distinct fittings upstream and downstream of the section, it was possible to install a by-pass that allows the normal pipeline flow to remain uninterupted. This procedure allowed the installation of the flow meters on the gas lines and flare lines of 6 Marlin asset platforms on the Campos Basin with no shutdown between February and October 2006. The project lasted for a full year and included planning, engineering design, preliminary inspection, fittings in-line welding, hot tapping and plugging and the installation of 27 flow meters. No production time was lost. A technology taskforce was formed to develop and approve the STOPPLE procedure, since no previous Petrobras standard existed prior to this project. All safety and technical issues were studied and developed to comply with Petrobras safety and quality standards. Through the use of Hot Tapping and Plugging with Bypass technology Petrobras reduced planned shutdown on 6 platforms by 35 days.

B2145,"Positive outlooks for fish biodiversity come from the evidence that individual fish populations respond positively to effective fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020) and that fish diversity and biomass increase within effective marine protected areas (Sala and Giakoumi, 2017). However, the global extinction of the smooth handfish Sympterichthys unipennis (Last and others, 2020) is a reminder that fish biodiversity continues to face significant threats as well. Both positive and negative outcomes are known because fishes continue to be among the most systematically studied and monitored components of marine ecosystems, mostly because of their economic value. Nonetheless, considerable fish diversity remains to be discovered: expert estimates indicate that at least another 700 fish species (approximately a 50 per cent increase over the number of currently known species) are yet to be described from the New Zealand exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf alone (Gordon and others, 2010; Roberts and others, 2019). Further increase in capacity in taxonomy and biosystematics (Taxonomy Decadal Plan Working Group, 2018) and the integration of data from existing biodiversity collections (Nelson and others, 2015) and other sources (Edgar and others, 2016) would pave the way for more comprehensive, synthetic analyses of fish biodiversity over the near to medium term. In addition to improving our understanding of fish biodiversity, improved estimates of fish biomass are needed for some ocean zones, such as the pelagic zone. While it is estimated that mesopelagic fishes dominate global fish biomass, estimates of their biomass span several orders of magnitude and, therefore, the exact contribution that this group makes to global patterns remains poorly understood (Irigoien and others, 2014; Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). In addition, while there are no current estimates of species richness or biomass of bathypelagic fishes, which reside in the world’s largest environment (in terms of volume), it is highly likely that those fishes constitute a large portion of global fish biomass (Sutton and others, 2017). Since the first Assessment, the disposal of deep-sea mining water after ore removal has emerged as a significant threat to bathypelagic fishes (Drazen and others, 2019).

B2575,"Inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to coastal ecosystems through river runoff and atmospheric deposition increased rapidly during the twentieth century owing to anthropogenic inputs derived primarily from the use of synthetic fertilizer, combustion of fossil fuels, cultivation of legumes (N2-fixation), production of manure by livestock and municipal wastes. Increases in anthropogenic nutrient inputs have fuelled a global increase in cultural eutrophication of the coastal ocean and now exceed inputs owing to natural processes. Ecological responses to the process of cultural eutrophication include increases in the severity and extent of coastal hypoxia, acidification and toxic algal events. Thus, cultural eutrophication is a serious threat to the health of coastal ecosystems and their capacity to provide services that are valued by society. It is projected that anthropogenic N and P production will increase by nearly a factor of two during the first half of the twenty-first century. Reducing anthropogenic inputs of N and P to the coastal ocean to minimize the extent and risk of coastal eutrophication during the course of the twenty-first century should be an international priority.

A411,"With the application of new technologies for processing and interpreting seismic data, PETROBRAS, in recent years, has achieved great success in the discovery of giant oil fields underlying thick layers of rock salt. Due to the mechanical behavior of these rocks, subject to the creep phenomenon, it was developed a large research and development project in order to determine the creep properties of these rocks and the application of computational simulations to predict the behavior of deep wells during the drilling of these layers. If on one hand the salt layers, with thicknesses ranging from 2000m to 5000 m, are a challenge in drilling activity, they can be considered in the logistic flow of gas and final destination of CO2. The rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which guarantees excellent impermeability to most fluids and gases, even under high pressures. Another phenomenon associated with rock salt is the process of self-healing. Taking advantage of these physical-chemical and structural properties of rock salt, caverns opened by dissolution in salt domes have been used for storage of hydrocarbons and other products. Considering the large regional thicknesses and continuity of rock salt overlying the presalt reservoirs, PETROBRAS is studying the strategy and technical and economic feasibility for the use of underground storage of natural gas and CO2 in salt caverns. Despite being a technology already dominated worldwide is unprecedented, the offshore application in deep and ultra-deep water.

A1075,"The Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC), Offshore Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario, posing great development challenges. The microbial carbonate reservoir is unusual regarding its origin and petrophysical properties; the fluids have a variable CO2 content; the few analogue reservoirs around the world do not compare in terms of volumes, water depth and distance to the coast; and there are also flow assurance issues. Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots. The current Petrobras Business Plan (2011-15) foresees mat the SBPSC areas alone will produce over 500,000 boe/d in 2015 and over 1,100,000 boe/d in 2020. These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account. On the other hand, when is it better to pay for extra flexibilities, accepting the inevitable CAPEX increase? Some examples would be: smart completions and possibility to inject different chemical products in the wells; gas and water separated lines for each satellite injector; flexible subsea layout, allowing multiples strategies and the addition of more wells; FPSO plants designed to inject desulphated water, or to export, import or reinject me gas, and also to separate variable CO2 contents in the produced fluids. This paper aims to discuss the influence of the main subsurface uncertainties in the selection of alternatives to develop the giant fields in the SBPSC, in a fast track way.

A1051,"Shipyards impact on estuarine environments because of the use of antifouling paints and petroleum products, which release trace metals that may remain in their bioavailable or labile form. Regardless of its importance, the relation between continuous input of trace metals (hotspot area) and their availability in the water column has been scarcely studied. This study evaluated seasonal variations in the concentrations of labile fractions of metals in shipyards located in estuarine areas on the Brazilian subtropical coast. These fractions were determined by the Diffuse Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique. Maximum labile fraction concentrations of Cr (0.3 μg L-1), Ni (2.2 μg L-1) and V (2.0 μg L-1) are directly related to (i) their specific source: antifouling paints (for Cr), metal and steel alloys (for Cr and Ni) and petroleum products (for V), besides (ii) periods of intensive traffic and vessel repair. Additionally, variations in labile fractions of Ni and V in the Patos Lagoon estuary were influenced by salinity, which is known to affect metal desorption from surface sediments in resuspension events. Even though Cr is affected by the same processes, it is available as Cr(III) and does not represent any ecological risk in the study areas. Although the areas under study are affected by variations in physical and chemical conditions, shipyards were effectively hotspots of trace metals in their labile fraction in various estuarine systems in southeastern and southern Brazil. Thus, they represent areas where Ecological Risk Assessment, mainly of V, should be carried out.

The model used was the semi-submersible ITTCSR192, at a scale 1:105. The main focus of this study is the analysis of the risers influence on the floating unit dynamics, taking into account damping effects caused by the lines. In order to establish basis of comparison the tests were performed with and without risers. These were modeled as a group of large diameter hoses that are able to provide a significant increment in the damping of the system. By such approach, it was possible to evaluate the changes on the dynamic behavior of the unit induced by the presence of risers. As an additional investigation tool, these results were analyzed with the aid of the software Numerical Offshore Tank (Tanque de Provas Numérico - TPN), which is a dynamic simulator of offshore systems based on parallel-processing developed by means of a partnership between the University of São Paulo, Petrobras and other Brazilian research institutions. By means of the comparisons between the model tests results with and without risers and of the results from the numerical tool, TPN, the dynamic behavior of the floating unit was investigated in terms of the effects caused by the presence of risers, which is a very relevant subject as offshore industry walks towards ultra-depth waters.

B2163,"Changes in impact Coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation pose severe risks to coastal infrastructure, property, economic activities and ecological systems, and adaptation calls for significant investment. There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018). The projection for risk and damage associated with coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation indicates that they are likely to increase in the future (Dunn and others, 2019). Ecosystem impacts from coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation can be substantial, in particular if there is a transformation from long-term accretion to erosion. Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b). Major socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density. Existing problems have been identified adjacent to the Ganges, Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, Volta and Mississippi river deltas. For other parts of the coast, the management of erosion hazards through the use of engineering interventions requires longterm commitments to maintenance, including the cost of upgrading coastal defensive works, with potential risk to human safety and livelihoods if defences are subject to decline. Local sea level rise and storminess vary significantly between regions. Based on long-term satellite data, wave height shows an overall global increase (Young and Ribal, 2019), but large regional differences are reported, from large changes in the Southern Ocean to negligible effects in the North Sea (De Winter and others, 2012). Such spatial variations are likely to result in regional variations in erosion and sedimentation (Brown and others, 2016).
 ","What are examples of geomorphic shapes that are altered by changes in sedimentation and erosion?

A1549,"Several Mesozoic successions of the Southern Tethyan margin were accumulated on a carbonate platform evolving to pelagic plateau depositional systems. Rifting paleotectonics was the main process conditioning their tectono-sedimentary evolution. The well-exposed outcrops in NW Sicilian fold and thrust belt of the so-called Trapanese carbonate platform to pelagic succession highlight the occurrence of lateral facies and thickness changes, paleofaults, volcanics, and resedimented deposits. The integration of facies analysis, stratigraphic data, and subsidence history have permitted to decipher the polyphase tectono-sedimentary evolution and to distinguish different depositional settings. Structural lows, filled with up to 100m-thick of pillow lavas and reworked deposits, appear as intraplatform basins bordered by structural highs, as horst ridges, characterised by condensed sedimentation, and isolated seamounts. These sectors were linked among them by stepped fault margins, scalloped margins and depositional slopes. The tectonic history, highlighted by the backstripped sections, reveals superimposed evolutionary stages reflecting rifting and rapid tectonic subsidence, leading to continental break-up (Late Triassic-Early Jurassic stage); the Middle Jurassic stage reflects slow thermal subsidence in the basin shoulders and higher rates in the intervening depressions; the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous regional uplift interrupts the thermal subsidence curve trend. The tract of the Late Cretaceous-Eocene curve suggests again slow thermal post-rift subsidence, also influenced by sediment load. The different subsidence curves, reconstructed from different positions in the sedimentary basin, demonstrate that its evolution could be driven by the identified syn-sedimentary faults that were formed and/or re-activated during several tectonic events encompassing the whole Jurassic-Cretaceous time period. The regional significance of this tectonics indicates that the Sicilian sector of the Southern Tethyan continental margin was tectonically active for the whole Mesozoic. The reconstructed paleophysiography of the Trapanese continental margin, during the Mesozoic, appears characterized by a segmented and drowned carbonate platform with morphostructural highs separated by deep channels. The comparison to the present-day morphostructural setting of some regions of the Atlantic continental margins (e.g. Caribbean, Brazilian Equatorial Margin), suggests also for the study region that the occurrence of transcurrent/transform faults and stretching of the continental lithosphere can have played an important role in determining the physiographic conformation.

B2567,"Environmental impacts Offshore oil and gas exploration and development practices have evolved significantly in terms of minimizing impacts on the surrounding environment, but operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts still occur. Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures. Produced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels. Most of the increase is expected from offshore oil and gas production (IFP Énergies Nouvelles, 2011). Disposal options include injection into the same formation from where the oil is produced, treating the produced water to meet a certain quality standard and then either discharging it into the environment or using treated water in oil and gas field operations. While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019). Although the funded projects focus on landbased drilling, many advances will be relevant to offshore oil and gas production. The emission of criteria pollutants related to platform or non-platform sources can have an impact on air quality in the vicinity of the drilling and production platforms. Platform sources comprise emissions from on-board equipment, such as boilers, natural gas engines and pneumatic pumps, while non-platform sources comprise emissions from pipe-laying operations, support and survey vessels and helicopters. In addition, open flaring of unwanted or excess gas from production platforms affects air quality.

B2153,"There are a number of threats to human health arising from the marine environment that have now been identified: Increase in the spread of pathogens related to climate warming (e.g., Vibrio). Also, there is some evidence related to an increase in some harmful algal bloom species related to climate warming is some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016); Recently, non-indigenous species, sometimes called invasive alien species, have started to be considered as one of the major threats to global marine ecosystems through impacts on the ecosystems’ structure, function and services (Galil, 2018). A small number of poisonous or venomous marine non-indigenous species represent potential threats to human health. Intensification of anthropogenic activities, coupled with rapidly increasing coastal urbanization, drive complex and fundamental changes in coastal waters, including increases in alien species. Some of the alien venomous and poisonous species have attracted the attention of scientists, managers, the media and the public for their conspicuous human health impacts. In the Mediterranean alone, 10 non-indigenous species are considered human health hazards, running the gamut from nuisance to lethal (Galil, 2018). Human health hazards of non-indigenous species are expected to worsen as a result of climate change. The poleward influx of warm water biota enables them to spread to regions as yet uncolonized; A further, recently identified health threat is the potential role of plastic marine litter as a vector for opportunistic human pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Barboza and others, 2018; Harrison and others, 2018; Imran and others, 2019). Various pathogenic bacteria bind, in particular and strongly, to plastic litter (for example, Vibrio cholerae and some strains of Escherichia coli). Such human pathogens can colonize plastic surfaces in stable biofilms. The scientific and medical understanding of that health threat of plastic pollution is inadequate but the threat is dealt with as a further aspect of the problem of marine litter discussed in chapter 12. A severe problem could arise in areas that are highly polluted as a result of natural disasters, climate crises or occurring epidemics, or in conflict zones (Vethaak and Leslie, 2016; Keswani and others, 2016; Galloway and others, 2017; Leonard and others, 2018a, 2018b; Moore and others, 2014).

A1880,"Estuarine systems are very sensitive environments to sea level rise as a consequence of climate changes, which can enhance seawater intrusion and affect multiple water uses. The seawater intrusion under sea level scenarios in an estuarine river by applying the one-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model HEC-RAS 5.0.5 was studied. The study was carried out at the estuarine reach of Cubatão River, in São Paulo, Brazil. Considering sea level rise scenarios of ΔH = 0.25 m, 0.50 m, and 1.0 m combined with constant freshwater discharge conditions for Cubatão River (16 m3/s, mean annual discharge and 8 m3/s, dry season discharge), the model results showed that seawater intrusion moves significantly upstream the river in all cases and the maximum seawater intrusion length may reach 10 km in the worst scenario (ΔH = 1.0 m and 8 m3/s freshwater discharge), 70% higher than the current sea level and the mean discharge. At the local water abstraction point for urban supply, salinity concentration may reach 12 g/kg, making conventional water treatment unfeasible. Sea level rise may threaten water supply facilities and require water resource management solutions, such as water abstraction restricted times when salinity concentration is low; higher freshwater reservation; new water abstraction locations, farther the present ones; or higher water discharges in Cubatão River from a local hydroelectric power plant, which can cause water resource management conflicts.

Besides saltmarshes, mangroves and coral reefs, this region also presents seagrass beds, macroalgae and rhodolith beds, forming underwater forests, which are key habitats for services such as biodiversity conservation, O2 production, and absorption of part of the CO2 from the atmosphere. Science endorses that ocean warming and acidification, sea level rise, biological invasions and their interactions with pollution, overfishing, and other stressors undermine the structure and functioning of these ecosystems, thus increasing the region's socio-environmental vulnerability. Ecosystem conservation, management and potential bioremediation/restoration using science-based solutions must be prioritized in order to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities and the ocean.

The lineament stands out in satellite images and topographic maps, extending for about 70 km in a N50°W direction, between the towns of Iconha and Conceição do Castelo (Espírito Santo). In order to investigate the nature and role played by the Piúma lineament in the tectonic evolution of the Mantiqueira Province and adjacent Campos Basin, we carried out a detailed structural analysis based on fieldwork, as well as geophysical data processing and interpretation. The results we obtained indicate that the Piúma lineament is a brittle shear zone characterized by N50W-trending and SW-dipping shear fractures, faults and joints. These structures record two distinct and incompatible motions, thereby recording the operation of two tectonic regimes: NNE-SSW extension and E-W transtension. Comparing our results with the literature on the Southeastern Brazilian Continental Margin, we conclude that the Piúma lineament more likely developed after the Ediacaran Brasiliano orogenic event in response to an NNE-SSW extension, experiencing later a reactivation as normal dextral to dextral transtensional zone, probably in connection with the South Atlantic rifting in the Lower Cretaceous.

B2189,"Impacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere Plankton Phytoplankton and marine bacteria carry out most of the primary production on which food webs depend. The climate-driven increases in the temperature of the upper ocean that had been predicted are now causing shifts in phytoplankton communities. This may have profound effects on net primary production and nutrient cycles over the next 100 years. In general, when smaller plankton account for most net primary production, as is typically the case in oligotrophic open-ocean waters (that is, areas where levels of nutrients are low), net primary production is lower and the microbial food web dominates energy flows and nutrient cycles. Under such conditions, the carrying capacity for currently harvestable fish stocks is lower and exports of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to the deep sea may be smaller. On the other hand, as the upper ocean warms, the geographic range of nitrogen-fixing plankton (diazotrophs) will expand. This could enhance the fixation of nitrogen by as much as 35-65 per cent by 2100. This would lead to an increase in net primary production, and therefore an increase in carbon uptake, and some species of a higher trophic level may become more productive. The balance between those two changes is unclear. A shift towards less primary production would have serious implications for human food security and the support of marine biodiversity.

B2551,"The major growth in aquatic production is expected to come from aquaculture and is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030, an increase of 37 per cent over 2016 levels. However, it is estimated that the annual growth rate of aquaculture will slow from 5.7 per cent in the period from 2003 to 2016 to 2.1 per cent in the period from 2017 to 2030, mainly because of a reduced rate of growth in Chinese production, offset in part by an increase in production in other countries (FAO, 2018a). The share of farmed aquatic animal species in global fishery production (for food and non-food uses), which was 47 per cent in 2016, is projected to exceed that of wild species in 2020 and to grow to 54 per cent by 2030. Over 87 per cent of the increase in aquaculture production in 2030 will come from Asian countries. Asia will continue to dominate world aquaculture production, contributing 89 per cent of total production in 2030. China will remain the world’s leading producer, but its share of total production will decrease from 62 per cent in 2016 to 59 per cent in 2030.

A1330,"The effects of the global climate change on oceans and coastal areas are manifested in many ways. In coastal environments, the climate change influence on coastal ecosystems is particularly worrisome, affecting their configuration and restricting the ecosystem services they produce and their benefits to nature and society. This possible loss of ecosystem services translates well the significance of the “environmental risk” that climate change can cause. An assessment of the environmental risk generated by climate threats in coastal ecosystems was carried out through a South American case study developed on the Southern coast of Brazil – Estuary of Patos Lagoon. The study involved the implementation of a model that estimates the risk of losing ecosystem services used by different stakeholder groups as a function of (1) the climate threat, (2) the value of the service defined by the stakeholder perception, and (3) the vulnerability of each group in relation to a possible service loss. Based on information generated by scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and from a significant database collected from interviews of several service users, the model was able to generate levels of risks for different conditions. The calculated risk values, standardized to values between zero and one, allow numerous possibilities of evaluation for ecosystems, user groups and climate variability indicators. Moreover, the model appears as a tool capable of generating comparative risk levels and can help to establish environmental management policies related to the climatic effects and the necessary adaptations.

A1754,"Oil offshore Brazil, as well as in other continents, has demanded floating units for oil production. Typical anchored production units are the semi-submersible platforms, FPSO, Spar Buoys and TLPs. All of them use several anchoring lines for station keeping. In the offshore Brazil scenario, the last twelve years the FPSOs adopts the torpedo piles and polyester ropes in the anchoring lines in deep and ultra-deep waters. The FPSO “Cidade de Angra dos Reis” was the first to operate in pre-salt area in October 2010. From then on, it became common the production units with VLCC size, oil production of 150,000 barrels per day and 24 anchoring lines. The reason for such large number of anchors is the 1,200 tonnes torpedo piles holding power restriction. The proposition developed in this paper reduces the number of anchor lines using well know offshore equipment such as: driven piles, mooring chains, polyester ropes and conventional anchoring deck equipment. The main difference is the use of driven piles with holding power above 1,800 tonnes and anchor lines with a breaking strength of more than 2,000 tonnes. It is shown that a decrease of number of anchoring lines from 24 to 12 can be achieved. Consequently, it will decrease also the space occupied by the anchoring lines in the seabed by reducing the subsea layout of risers, flow lines and well head. This allows a technical and economical scenario more feasible when compared with the currently used on the Brazilian oil & gas market.

Coastal communities play a key role in supporting all components of the ocean economy, as well as a range of social and cultural values, and all forms of coastal and marine management and governance. While coastal communities often have to deal with physical and social vulnerabilities, they are crucial contributors to conservation, to marine hazard responses and to climate mitigation and adaptation. The ocean supports a wide range of economic activities, including the harvesting of food, shipping, seabed mining, offshore hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, tourism and recreation, use of marine genetic resources, production of fresh water by desalinization and production of salt. The various economic activities are steadily growing in scale. Separate chapters in part 5 of the present Assessment, on trends in pressures on the marine environment, give more detail on areas not discussed in depth here. Shipping carries about 90 per cent by volume of international trade, which makes it fundamental to the global economy. It is still recovering from the economic crisis of the period 2008–2011. Globally, tourism continues to grow at about 6 per cent per year.

A760,"Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree. After being disassembled, the new subsea safety tree was inspected; the inspection showed minimal damage and erosion on the inside walls of the tool, indicating that the equipment would qualify for this type of offshore operation.

In offshore environments these extended well tests (EWT) are performed by ships that are able to store the produced oil in cargo tanks for subsequent offloading. In pursuit of a more environmentally friendly alternative, PETROBRAS has researched gas to liquid (GTL) technology, which converts natural gas into synthetic crude oil that can be mixed with the produced oil for storage and offloading. Numerical simulations were carried out taking into account a pre-reforming, steam methane reforming and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis section via a steady state refining process simulator called PETROX developed by Petrobras. Two single trains of natural gas feed containing CO2 were considered. CO2 was consumed in the steam methane reactor to form CO as a consequence of equilibrium change in the steam methane and water-gas-shift reactions. Nevertheless, the GTL overall process cannot be considered a CO2 sequestration process yet, since the net CO2 process balance is positive. The results show that there are optimization opportunities to develop pre-reformer catalysts less selective to CO2 production and reformer catalysts capable of increasing the dry reforming reaction extension with no coke formation. In addition, changes in the process can be done to replace natural gas by hydrogen in the reformer combustion to increase the overall carbon efficiency and reduce the CO2 emission. The observed reduction in the overall syncrude production with high CO2 content is acceptable to the EWT scenario.

B2113,"The growing scale of human activities and the associated impacts on the marine environment mean that conflicts are increasingly occurring between different uses of the ocean. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an effective way of resolving such conflicts. Over the past two decades, MSP has been instituted to a growing extent in many jurisdictions, in a variety of forms: some are simply zoning plans; others include more complex management systems. The legal status of MSP varies between jurisdictions: in some, it is guidance to be taken into account; in others, it has legal force constraining specific management decisions. In general, MSP has been most effective where it has been developed with the involvement of all relevant authorities and stakeholders.

B1998,"Increasing inputs of harmful material Eutrophication Eutrophication resulting from excess inputs of nutrients from both agriculture and sewage causes algal blooms. Those can generate toxins that can make fish and other seafood unfit for human consumption. Algal blooms can also lead to anoxic areas (i.e. dead zones) and hypoxic zones. Such zones have serious consequences from environmental, economic and social aspects. The anoxic and hypoxic zones drive fish away and kill the benthic wildlife. Where those zones are seasonal, any regeneration that happens is usually at a lower trophic level, and the ecosystems are therefore degraded. This seriously affects the maritime economy, both for fishermen and, where tourism depends on the attractiveness of the ecosystem (for example, around coral reefs), for the tourist industry. Social consequences are then easy to see, both through the economic effects on the fishing and tourist industries and in depriving the local human populations of food.

A1237,"The lastest discoveries of oil and gas reserves in the Brazilian offshore area present new challenges on gas transportation due to their location, far away from the coast. For these new scenarios, Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) units may be a good solution for a natural gas volume production around 2.5 MTPA. It is worth saying that this technology hasn't been proved yet. So, there are many challenges to overcome to turn the FLNG into an economically and technically feasible solution for these new scenarios. One of the main challenges for establishing a LNG (liquefied natural gas) offshore unit is the definition of the liquefaction process technology to be used. Characteristics such as motion effects, footprint, robustness, operational flexibility and asiness, safety, maintenance and availability must be considered when the main differences between the processes are being identified. Depending on the capacity to be attended, liquefaction processes may use hydrocarbon refrigerant mixtures or inert refrigerant fluids. Due to the environmental conditions in Brazilian waters, side-by-side offloading operations are not possible, as the operational availability would not be large enough. Therefore, LNG offloading would only be achieved through the tandem operational mode. Since the technology available for this kind of operation uses aerial hoses, it will be necessary to provide a bow loading system (BLS) installed on the LNG carrier and also a dynamic positioning system (DP) may be needed for an accurate control of the positioning and maintenance of a relative heading. The study indicates that the cargo containment system (CCS) should fulfill some constraints: let free upper deck area for topsides facilities; withstand any partial filling condition (sloshing impacts); have a good track record; and its configuration should allow inspection and maintenance in the offshore environment. This paper reports the Petrobras findings on the evaluating of the FLNG technology. Petrobras considers the FLNG unit an attractive option for its scenario, although many sub-systems still present important challenges in order to achieve a good overall performance. The choice of the best technology for each sub-system is still on-going, aiming the largest reliability and the minimum cost possible.

B2015,"The Southern Ocean (defined as all ocean area south of 60°S) deserves special mention due to its role in the storage of heat (and carbon) for the entire planet. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.

A170,"The Southern Brazilian Coast is highly susceptible to storm surges that often lead to coastal flooding and erosive processes, significantly impacting coastal communities. In addition, climate change is expected to result in expressive increases in wave heights due to more intense and frequent storms, which, in conjunction with sea-level rise (SLR), has the potential to exacerbate the impact of storm surges on coastal communities. The ability to predict and simulate such events provides a powerful tool for coastal risk reduction and adaptation. In this context, this study aims to investigate how accurately storm surge events can be simulated in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean employing the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN hydrodynamic and phase-averaged wave numerical modeling framework given the significant data scarcity constraints of the region. The model’s total water level (TWL) and significant wave height (Hs) outputs, driven by different sources of meteorological forcing, i.e., the Fifth Generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA 5), the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2), and the Global Forecast System (GFS), were validated for three recent storm events that affected the coast (2016, 2017, and 2019). In order to assess the potentially increasing storm surge impacts due to sea-level rise, a case study was implemented to locally evaluate the modeling approach using the most accurate model setup for two 2100 SLR projections (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Despite a TWL underestimation in all sets of simulations, the CFSv2 model stood out as the most consistent meteorological forcing for the hindcasting of the storm surge and waves in the numerical model, with an RMSE range varying from 0.19 m to 0.37 m, and an RMSE of 0.56 m for Hs during the most significant event. ERA5 was highlighted as the second most accurate meteorological forcing, while adequately simulating the peak timings. The SLR study case demonstrated a possible increase of up to 82% in the TWL during the same event. Despite the limitations imposed by the lack of continuous and densely distributed observational data, as well as up to date topobathymetric datasets, the proposed framework was capable of expanding TWL and Hs information, previously available for a handful of gauge stations, to a spatially distributed and temporally unlimited scale. This more comprehensive understanding of such extreme events represents valuable knowledge for the potential implementation of more adequate coastal management and engineering practices for the Brazilian coastal zone, especially under changing climate conditions.
 ","What should be the cause of the expressive increases in wave heights with climate change?
 ","The study involved the implementation of a model that estimates the risk of losing ecosystem services used by different stakeholder groups as a function of (1) the climate threat, (2) the value of the service defined by the stakeholder perception, and (3) the vulnerability of each group in relation to a possible service loss.
 ","With the increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified coastlines, there is a high risk of ecological disturbance to organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nursery purposes, which also reduces the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone.

However, high-resolution quantitative biostratigraphic studies, integrating planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils, are still lacking for the time interval spanning the Oligocene–Miocene transition. Here, we present a reinvestigation of Deep Sea Drilling Project Hole 516F (Rio Grande Rise) and 4 oil wells drilled by Petróbras Brasileiro SA in the Campos Basin (SW Atlantic Ocean).

Detailed thin section and cathodoluminescence petrography, scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe analyses established a paragenetic evolution of diagenetic processes and products, comprising extensive dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution. A paragenesis including saddle dolomite, macrocrystalline calcite, mega-quartz, Sr-barite, celestine, fluorite, dickite, sphalerite, galena, and other metallic sulfides filling fractures and dissolution porosity, and aqueous fluid inclusions with homogenization temperatures of 92–152 °C and salinities between 13 and 26 wt % eq. NaCl characterized a hydrothermal system with some analogy to carbonate-hosted Pb–Zn Mississippi Valley (MVT) and Irish-type deposits. Petroleum inclusions and solid bitumen testify atypical oil generation and migration, associated with the hydrothermal flow. The host Pre-Salt spherulitic and fascicular carbonates present highly radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios, indicating strong interaction with continental crust materials. Hydrothermal phases show δ18O values more negative than syngenetic and diagenetic carbonates. The δ13C values are interpreted as result of interaction between the hydrothermal fluids and the host rocks. The combined data set provides clear evidence of intense hydrothermal alteration of northern Campos Basin Pre-Salt reservoirs at deep-burial conditions (>2 km), possibly related to Late Cretaceous or more probably Paleogene magmatic activity.

Increase in seawater temperature affects their reproduction and survival, which will consequently affect their population distribution and harvest. Kelp die-offs have already been reported along the coasts of Europe, and changes in species distribution have been noted in Northern Europe, Southern Africa and Southern Australia, with warm-water-tolerant species replacing those that are intolerant of warmer water. The diminished kelp harvest reduces what is available for human food and the supply of substances derived from kelp that are used in industry and pharmaceutical and food preparation. Communities with kelp-based livelihoods and economies will be affected. For seagrasses, increased seawater temperatures have been implicated in the occurrence of a wasting disease that decimated seagrass meadows in the north-eastern and northwestern parts of the United States.

B2250,"The new map shows the way in which the ocean consists of four main basins (the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean) between the tectonic plates that form the continents. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea). The water of the ocean circulates within these geological structures. This water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the sea water. Salinity varies according to the relativity between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Sea areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, with large amounts of freshwater coming from rivers and relatively low evaporation have low salinity – 8 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively, as compared with the global average of 35 parts per thousand (HELCOM 2010, Black Sea Commission 2008). The Red Sea, in contrast, with low riverine input and high insolation, and therefore high evaporation, has a mean surface salinity as high as 42.5 parts per thousand (Heilman et al 2009). Seawater can also be stratified into separate layers, with different salinities and different temperatures. Such stratification can lead to variations in both the oxygen content and nutrient content, with critical consequences in both cases for the biota dependent on them. A further variation is in the penetration of light. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis of inorganic carbon (mainly CO2) into the organic carbon of plants and mixotrophic species1 . Even clear water reduces the level of light that can penetrate by about 90 per cent for every 75 metres of depth. Below 200 metres depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis (Widder 2014). The upper 200 metres of the ocean are therefore where most photosynthesis takes place (the euphotic zone). Variations in light level in the water column and on the sea bed are caused by seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion. Where turbidity occurs, it can reduce the penetration of light by up to 95 per cent, and thus reduce the level of photosynthesis which can take place (Anthony 2004).
 ","What are the reasons for variations in the penetration of sunlight into ocean?
 ","seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion.

A306,"Brazilian offshore scenario requires innovative solutions in order to increase the efficiency of operations, while still keeping the safety and the economical constraints. The global market and naval industry cannot meet the demand of the growing exploration activities, related to the recent discovery of new oil fields. Furthermore, they are located at a large distance from the shore (approximately 300km) and the environmental conditions are severe. These facts impose more logistics problems for materials and persons transportations. The retrofitting of vessels is an alternative for increasing their operability and this option has been studied by Transpetro, subsidiary of Petrobras responsible for the Ducts, Terminals, Maritime Transport and Natural Gas segments. This paper presents two real cases of retrofitting related to the application of new technologies for positioning, including Dynamic Positioning (DP) Systems or manually operated thrusters. In the first case, a conventional tanker will be converted to a DP2 tanker, in order to operate close to drill ships and to transfer fluids during the drilling operation. The second case is related to an offshore delivering vessel used for bunkering operation. This vessel is moored at a monobuoy, and up to 2 receiving vessels may be connected to it. An aft-azimuth thruster will be installed in the vessel, increasing its capacity to change heading in harsh environmental conditions and to keep a safe distance from the monobuoy during fast variations of environmental conditions. Both cases require the application of a comprehensive design methodology for thruster dimensioning. The retrofitting imposes tight constraints to the layout and positioning of the thrusters. Also, the proximity to others vessels and the harsh environmental conditions in the offshore fields requires a combination of static and dynamic calculation in order to evaluate power consumption and drift motions of the vessels.

SLWRs have been used successfully in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Australia. However, it is probably the most computationally intensive aspect of it. Fatigue analysis requires a large number of load cases to be performed, in complex nonlinear models.
 ","There are a number of threats to human health from the marine environment that have already been identified, as an increase in the spread of climate warming related pathogens (e.g. Vibrio). In addition, there is some evidence related to the increase of some harmful algal species related to climate warming in some regions (Hinder and others, 2012; Vezzulli and others, 2016).

B2564,"Coastal and marine infrastructures are necessary for the use, exploitation and protection of the coastal and marine natural resources and environment for socioeconomic development. In general, if well-designed and well-built, coastal infrastructure development can be ecologically as well as economically and socially sustainable, increase the resilience of coasts and lead to sustainable economic growth. Infrastructures can influence natural systems and their use and create pressures and conflicts or favourable conditions. Between 2010 and 2020, there was an upward trend in newly developed, renovated or upgraded marine and coastal infrastructure. The most significant changes are coastal and offshore land reclamation, especially in East Asian countries, for new coastal urban development, roads, coastal defence structures, port and harbour facilities and tourist facilities. Depending on the case, coastal and marine infrastructures may cause substantial damage or reduce damage to coastal and marine ecosystems. The new coastal infrastructure development approach, known as “blue infrastructure development”, can harmonize coastal protection and development, as well as habitat and ecological protection, thereby reducing ecological damage. Coastal and marine infrastructure development in general has created new opportunities for coastal dwellers and supported sustainable socioeconomic coastal development.
 ","What are the most significant changes in East Asian countries?

 ","The Brazilian government's concern with the use of marine resources and coastal areas emerged in this decade.
 ","With the increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified coastlines, there is a high risk of ecological disturbance to organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nursery purposes, which also reduces the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone.

A397,"Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil. The recently created Petrobras Heavy Oil Technological Program - PROPES - is in charge of the development, together with universities, service companies and the industry, of new technologies for the offshore heavy oil fields. The main objective of all this work is to set the basis for the economical development of the significant volumes of heavy oil already discovered offshore Brazil. This paper presents the main research and development topics of the Petrobras Heavy Oil Program, as well as the key production technologies for the target fields. Additionally, the results of some well tests and Extended Well Tests (EWT) in heavy oil reservoirs in the Campos Basin are presented and discussed.

A915,"This paper addresses the results from a monitoring inspection as part of Petrobras regular plane of inspection of rigid pipelines (PIDR) and numerical Finite Element analysis (FEA) of two parallel HP/HT subsea pipelines operating in Brazilian deepwater subjected to lateral buckling and walking behaviors. The results obtained from inspection and numerical reanalysis furnishes important feedback for the integrity management of the two pipelines, reducing potential risks and lessons learned for future projects. Deepwater pipelines submitted to high pressures and temperatures (HP/HT) are susceptible to global buckling due to axial compressive load. To guarantee pipeline and equipment’s integrity frequently is necessary to relieve high stresses and strains at buckle apex as well as to mitigate end expansion. Thus, the two parallel HP/HT pipelines were designed with single and double sleepers to trigger buckles at pre-determined locations and an anchoring system to prevent pipeline walking. Another important design aspect was to avoid undesirable buckles at the several crossings along the pipeline route applying a special device with stoppers to lock lateral displacements. During a programmed inspection as part of regular Petrobras pipeline integrity program of rigid pipelines (PIDR), it has been verified that some double sleepers didn’t work as foreseen in design. Otherwise, some unplanned buckles on soil have been formed along the two pipelines changing the buckle apex stress levels and end expansions foreseen in detailed design. In order to understand buckle formation behavior and guarantee long-term integrity of the HP/HT pipelines a Multi-Beam Echosounder Survey (MBES) was conducted in 2016 to build a representative Finite Element (FE) model. The temperature and pressure gradients from steady state and transient conditions were obtained from flow assurance simulations based on monitored platform operational historic data. The FE model was calibrated with buckle shapes and end displacements to assess pipeline behavior and its long-term integrity for load scenarios different from original design.
 ","In order to guarantee the integrity of the HP / HT subsea pipeline and equipment, which procedures are necessary?
