Technological advances in the past decade have encouraged exploration in deep and ultradeep waters further away from shore and enabled the discovery of significant new reserves. The water depth capabilities for offshore exploration increased from about 3,050 m to more than 3,350 m between 2010 and 2018, while production capability using floating platforms reached almost 2,900 m in 2018, up from 2,438 m in 2010 (Barton and others, 2019). Such technological advances have in part enabled the expansion of the offshore oil and gas sector to new regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and areas off the coast of Guyana.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere have also been advances in understanding the potential environmental and social impacts of exploration and production activities on the surrounding environment and in the development of new approaches to mitigate impacts. For example, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has created a Marine Noise Registry to record human activities that produce loud impulsive noise (10 Hz– 10 kHz) in the seas around its territory. This initiative intends to create baseline data and to quantify the pressure on the environment from anthropogenic activities associated with hydrocarbon exploration and development, including seismic surveys, sub-bottom profiling and pile driving. Similarly, the SERPENT project, which stands for “Scientific and Environmental ROV (remotely operated vehicle) Partnership using Existing iNdustrial Technology”, is an example of international collaboration among the scientific community, environmental regulators and the oil and gas industry to gather and provide baseline information on ecosystems around offshore oil and gas installations using cutting-edge remotely operated vehicles that can operate in the deep ocean (SERPENT Project, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMore recently, the offshore oil and gas industry has contributed to the MRE sector by providing expertise for the construction, maintenance and decommissioning of utility-scale offshore wind projects.

Many other types of marine biotas have also been shown to be affected by anthropogenic noise. Other significant sources of noise are seismic exploration for the offshore hydrocarbon industry and sonar.

The most dense ocean water is cold and salty which sinks beneath warm and fresh seawater that stays near the surface. Cold-salty water is produced in sea ice “factories” of the polar seas: when seawater freezes, the salt is rejected (the ice is mostly fresh water), which makes the remaining liquid seawater saltier.

As the pattern of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons changes, submarine areas that have so far been stable may become less so and thus produce submarine landslides and consequent cable breaks.

The movement of species between the Pacific and the Atlantic demonstrates the scale of the potential impact. Those routes are shorter and may be more economic, but shipping brings with it increased risks of marine pollution both from acute disasters and chronic pollution and the potential introduction of invasive non-native species. The very low rate at which bacteria can break down spilled oil in polar conditions and the general low recovery rate of polar ecosystems mean that damage from such pollution would be very serious. Furthermore, the response and clear-up infrastructure found in other ocean basins is largely lacking today around the Arctic Ocean. Those factors would make such problems even worse.

Today 44 per cent of the world's population lives on or within 150 kilometres from the coast (United Nations Atlas of Oceans). However this fundamental connection between nature and people has only very recently been incorporated into trans-disciplinary thinking on how we manage and account for the human benefits we get from nature. Today, when a product taken from an ecosystem1 , for example, fibres, timber or fish, enters the economic cycle (i.e., a part of the human system), it receives a monetary value that accounts at least for the costs associated with its extraction and mobilization. If that natural product is the result of cultivation, as in the case of agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, the monetary value also includes the production costs. However, the extraction of natural products and other human benefits from ecosystems has implicit costs of production and other ancillary costs associated with preserving the integrity of the natural production system itself. Traditionally these benefits and costs have been hidden within the “natural system,” and are not accounted for financially; such hidden costs and benefits are considered “externalities” by neoclassical economists. While the neoclassical economic toolbox includes non-market valuation approaches, an ecosystem services approach emphasizes that ‘price’ is not equal to “value” and highlights human well-being, as a normative goal. The emergence and evolution of the ecosystem services concept offers an explicit attempt to better capture and reflect these hidden or unaccounted benefits and associated costs when the natural “production” system is negatively affected by human activities. The ecosystem services approach has proven to be very useful in the management of multi-sector processes and already informs many management and regulatory processes around the world (e.g. United Kingdom National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2530","2","What is the annual mean rate of sea level growth that has been occurring since 1993 ?","Qual é a taxa média anual de crescimento do nível do mar que vem ocorrendo desde 1993 ?","Each year, what has been the average annual rate of sea level growth since 1993?","A cada ano, qual tem sido a taxa média anual de crescimento do nível do mar, desde 1993?","3.1 ± 0.3 mm","3.1 ± 0.3 mm","The mean rate is 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year","A taxa média é de 3.1 ± 0.3 mm por ano","","\u003cp\u003eOcean warming and land ice melt are the main causes of present-day accelerating global mean sea level rise.

Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions.

One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future.

Some of those species are the subject of direct harvesting, particularly some pinnipeds (seals and related species) and seabirds, and by-catch in fisheries can be a significant mortality source for many species. However, in addition to having to sustain the impact of those direct deaths, all of those species suffer from varying levels of exposure to pollution from land-based sources and increasing levels of noise in the ocean.

However, for seabirds alone, at least 10 different pressures have been identified that can affect a single population throughout its annual cycle, with efforts to mitigate one pressure sometimes increasing vulnerability to others.

Good progress has been made over the past 40 years in reducing both. There have been large increases in the global tonnage of cargo carried by sea and in the distances over which those cargoes are carried. There have also been steady increases in the number of passengers carried on cruise ships and ferries. In spite of this, the absolute number of ship losses has steadily decreased. Between 2002 and 2013, the number of losses of ships of over 1,000 gross tonnage thus dropped by 45 per cent to 94. This is largely due to efforts under the three main international maritime safety conventions: the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea,87 dealing with ship construction and navigation, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, 88 dealing with crew, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePollution from oil has been the most significant type of marine pollution from ships. The number of spills exceeding 7 tons has dropped steadily, in spite of the growth in the quantity carried and the length of voyages, from over 100 spills in 1974 to under five in 2012. The total quantity of oil released in those spills has also been reduced by an even greater factor. Progress has also been made in improving response capabilities, though much remains to be done, especially as coastal States have to bear the capital cost of acquiring the necessary equipment. Reductions in oil pollution have resulted from more effective enforcement of the MARPOL requirements, particularly in western Europe. The changes in arrangements for reparation for any damage caused by oil pollution from ships have improved the economic position of those affected.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of all that progress, oil discharges from ships remain an environmental problem, for example, around the southern tip of Africa and in the North-West Atlantic. Off the coast of Argentina, however, a solution to the impact of those discharges on penguin colonies seems to have been found by rerouting coastal shipping. The likely opening of shipping routes through the Arctic between the Atlantic and the Pacific risks introducing that form of pollution into a sea area where response infrastructure is lacking, oil recovery in freezing conditions is difficult and the icy water temperature inhibits the microbial breakdown of the oil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePollution from cargoes of hazardous and noxious substances appears to be a much smaller problem, even though there are clearly problems with misdescriptions of the contents of containers.

In 2016, Asia accounted for 85.7 per cent of the global population engaged in fisheries and aquaculture (FAO, 2018a),which represents an increase of more than 1 per cent since 2014. More than 19 million people (32  per  cent of all people employed in the sector) were engaged in fish farming, and 95.9  per  cent of all aquaculture activities were being conducted in Asia. The statistics clearly indicate the important and increasing contribution of aquaculture to that continent’s regional food and nutrition security, as well as its socioeconomic development.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several major reviews on the subject (Allison, 2011; Béné and others, 2016). Fishes provide more than 4.5 billion people with at least 15 per cent of their animal protein intake. The nutritional properties of fishes make them important to the health of consumers in developed and developing countries. Fishes are efficient converters of feed into high quality food and their carbon footprint is lower than that of other animal production systems. Fisheries and aquaculture value chains contribute substantially to the income and employment, and therefore indirectly to the food security, of more than 10 per cent of the world’s population, principally in developing countries and emerging economies (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 80 million tons of aquatic animals produced in 2016 contributed 46 per cent to total aquatic animal production and a little over 54  per  cent to total fish consumption in the same year.

The goal of most food safety systems is to avoid risk and prevent problems at the source. The risks come from contamination from pathogens (particularly from discharges of untreated sewage and animal waste) and toxins (often from algal blooms).

The overall market remains dominated by passengers from the United States (about 50 per cent of the total market) and the global distribution of cruising remains largely as described in the first Assessment, with the major focuses being the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, which together accounted for a little over half of all traffic in 2017 (Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first Assessment noted the relatively recent, but rapid, growth of tourism to Antarctica, in particular with regard to cruise ships – from 27,324 cruise ship passengers in the 2003– 2004 season to 37,044 in the 2013–2014 season, which is an increase of 35 per cent. The growth has continued, reaching 51,700 in the 2017–2018 season (an increase of a further 40 per cent), with a forecast of further growth to 55,750 in the 2018–2019 season. Over 80 per cent of the tourists land on Antarctica (International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), 2018). Passenger landings and marine traffic are highly concentrated at a few specific locations, in particular along the Antarctic Peninsula’s south-western coast. Growth in Antarctic tourism is closely correlated with the economies of the countries sending the most visitors to the region: 60 per cent of the tourists come from the United States (33 per cent), China (16 per cent) and Australia (11 per cent). The proportion of tourists from China increased significantly between 2013 and 2014 and between 2017 and 2018. Markets for Antarctic travel are probably far from saturated, and demand is therefore likely to continue to grow (Bender and others, 2016).

While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019).

Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment.

Those changes are manifested in enhanced salinities in the near-surface, high-salinity subtropical regions and corresponding freshening in the low-salinity regions such as the West Pacific Warm Pool and the poles. Similar changes are also seen in the ocean subsurface, with similar patterns of freshening low-salinity waters and enhanced high-salinity waters represented in each of the ocean basins, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian, and across the Southern Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e \n ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2224","2","Which was the region with the greatest increase in mean ocean temperature during the period from 1971 to 2010?","Qual foi a região com o maior aumento na temperatura média do oceano durante o período de 1971 a 2010?","Which region saw the biggest increase in ocean temperature between the years 1971 and 2010?","Que região apresentou o maior aumento de temperatura oceânica entre os anos de 1971 e 2010?","the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic","o hemisfério norte, especialmente no Atlântico Norte","The North Atlantic Ocean region.","A região do oceâno Atlântico norte.","","\u003ch1\u003eImpacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eSea-surface temperature\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reaffirmed in its fifth report its conclusion that global sea-surface temperatures have increased since the late nineteenth century.

Changes in global mean sea level are largely caused by a combination of changes in ocean heat content and exchanges of freshwater between the ocean and continents. When water is added to the ocean, global sea level adjusts, rapidly resulting in a relatively uniform spatial pattern for the seasonal ocean mass balance, as compared to the seasonal steric signal, which has very large regional amplitudes (Chambers, 2006). ‘Steric’ refers to density changes in seawater due to changes in heat content and salinity. On annual scales, the maximum exchange of freshwater from land to ocean occurs in the late Northern Hemisphere summer, and therefore the seasonal ocean mass signal is in phase with total sea level with an amplitude of about 7 mm (Chambers et al., 2004). Because most of the ocean is in the Southern Hemisphere, the seasonal maximum in the steric component occurs in the late Southern Hemisphere summer, when heat storage in the majority of the ocean peaks (Leuliette and Willis, 2011). Because globally averaged sea level variations due to heat content changes largely cancel out between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the size of the steric signal, globally averaged, is only 4 mm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobally averaged sea level has risen at 3.2 mm/yr for the past two decades (Church et al., 2011), of which about a third comes from thermal expansion. The remainder is due to fluxes of freshwater from the continents, which have increased as the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets responds to higher temperatures. Multi-decadal fluctuations in equatorial and mid-latitude winds (Merrifield et al., 2012; Moon et al., 2013) cause regional patterns in sea-level trends which are reflected in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) indices in the Pacific (Merrifield et al., 2012; Zhang and Church, 2012) and northern Australia (White et al., 2014). Interannual changes in global mean sea level relative to the observed trend are largely linked to exchanges of water with the continents due to changes in precipitation patterns associated largely with the ENSO; this includes a drop of 5 mm during 2010-11 and rapid rebound in 2012-13 (Boening et al., 2012; Fasullo et al., 2013).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,4,3,4," What"],["B2046","2","Which are the three major southern ocean basins?","Quais são as três maiores bacias oceânicas do sul?","What are the three largest Antartic Ocean basins?","Quais os nomes das três principais bacias no Oceano Antártico?","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian basins.","Bacias do Atlântico sul, do Pacífico sul e do Oceano Índico.","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian","Atlântico Sul, Pacífico Sul e Índico","","\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Ocean (defined as all ocean area south of 60°S) deserves special mention due to its role in the storage of heat (and carbon) for the entire planet. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2156","2","What has caused an increase in the establishment of marine protected areas and an associated increase in the protection of the marine environment?","O que causou um aumento no estabelecimento de áreas marinhas protegidas e um aumento associado na proteção do ambiente marinho?","The increased delimitation of marine protected areas and increased marine environmental protection are consequences of what?","O aumento de delimitação de áreas marinhas protegidas e aumento da proteção ambiental marinha são consequências de que?","Targets set in association with international agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.","Metas colocadas em associação com acordos internacionais como as Metas de Biodiversidade de Aichi e as Metas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável.","Targets set in association with international agreements","Objetivos colocados em associação com acordos internacionais","","\u003ch1\u003eChanging governance structures and geopolitical instability\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMany international treaties and agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972, the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are aimed at reducing pressures on the marine environment and improving conservation outcomes. Targets set in association with international agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, have led to an increase in the establishment of marine protected areas and an associated increase in the protection of the marine environment.

Corporations have increased potential to negotiate directly with Governments, which could hamper progress towards sustainable outcomes for the marine environment. Where there is conflict over access to resources and property rights, policies and agreements focused on sustainability can be undermined by such conflicts (Suárez-de Vivero and Rodríguez Mateos, 2017).

The Agreement is aimed at strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is recognized in the Agreement that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation of all countries.

Thanks to international efforts, fishing methods have changed and the by-catch has been reduced significantly. Commercial fisheries are the most serious pressure at sea that the world’s seabirds face, although there is evidence of some reductions of by-catch in some key fisheries. Each year, incidental by-catch in longline fisheries is estimated to kill at least 160,000 albatrosses and petrels, mainly in the southern hemisphere.

Changes that have been identified include shifts in the seasonal distribution and amount of precipitation, an increase in extreme precipitation events, changes in the balance between snow and rain, accelerated melting of glacial ice, and of course sea-level rise. Although a global phenomenon, it is the impact of sea-level rise along the world’s coastlines that has major societal implications. The impacts of these changes are discussed in the next Section.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in the rates of freshwater exchange between the ocean, atmosphere and continents have additional significant impacts. For example, spatial variations in the distribution of evaporation and precipitation create gradients in salinity and heat that in turn drive ocean circulation; ocean freshening also affects ecosystem structure. These aspects and their impacts are discussed in Sections 3 and 4.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother factor potentially contributing to regional changes in the hydrological cycle are changes in ocean surface currents. For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,2," What"],["B2421","2","How can aquaculture become more sustainable?","Como a aquicultura pode se tornar mais sustentável?","Which practice should be adopted for aquaculture to be a more sustainable ?","Qual pratica deve ser adotada para a aquicultura ser uma atividade mais sustentável ?","By ensuring aquafeed production is adequate","Garantindo que a produção de ração seja adequada","The aquaculture should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.","A aquicultura de se esforçar para garantir o fornecimento sustentável de ingredientes para rações terrestres e vegetais, incluindo algas e resíduos de processamento, que não competem diretamente com o uso para alimentação direta de pessoas.\n","","\u003ch1\u003eInputs and resources\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eLand and water are the most important resources for aquaculture development. Gentry and others (2017) estimated that 11,400,000 km2 of coastline are suitable for fishes, and more than 1,500,000 km2 could be developed for bivalves. The challenge is to secure suitable land and water resources for the development of aquaculture at the national level.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGood quality seeds and optimal feeds are essential. Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern. In 2016, about 55.6 million tons of farmed fishes (including Indian carps) and crustaceans depended on external feeds (composed of fresh ingredients, farm-made or commercially manufactured) (FAO, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, aquaculture consumed about 4.2 million tons of fishmeal (18.5  per  cent of total aquafeeds by weight). By 2015, this had been reduced to 3.35 million tons (7 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014).

Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore.

practices have evolved significantly in terms of minimizing impacts on the surrounding environment, but operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts still occur. Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eProduced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019).

Even though they have different names, they form one single interconnected ocean system. The basins have been created over geological times by the movement of the tectonic plates across the Earth’s mantle. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles to the continental slopes leading down to the continental rises and the abyssal plains. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift-valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine, when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) have created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins, there are marginal seas, more or less separated from the main ocean basins by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges and formed by various processes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean mixes and circulates within those geological structures. Although the proportion of the different chemical components dissolved in seawater is essentially constant over time, that water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the seawater. Salinity varies according to the relative balance between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Differences in salinity and temperature of water masses can cause seawater to be stratified into separate layers. Such stratification can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients, with an obvious variety of consequences in both cases for the biotas sensitive to those factors. A further variation is in the penetration of light, which controls where the photosynthesis on which nearly all ocean life depends can take place. Below a few tens of metres at the coastal level or a few hundred meters in the clearer open ocean, the ocean becomes dark and there is no photosynthesis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuperimposed on all this is a change in the acidity of the ocean.

Based on the statistics of the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, between 2013 and 2019, there was about 6 per cent growth in the number of establishments offering diving training (about 6,600 in 2019), about 1 per cent growth in the number of individual trainers (about 137,000 in 2019) and about an 11  per  cent increase in the number of people trained annually (about 1 million in 2019) (Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main interest in diving lies in areas endowed with coral reefs – the corals and other reef biota are spectacular and attract large numbers of tourists who want to see them. In some areas, as recorded in the first Assessment, studies suggest that it is possible to manage coral reef tourism (e.g., by limiting the number of divers in an area, specifying divers’ behaviour and generally increasing divers’ awareness of the problems) compatibly with sustaining the condition and health of the reef. In other areas, however, studies continue to suggest that the interaction of divers with coral is damaging the reefs. A recent study of the coral reefs around the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean part of the Netherlands showed that diving is at levels probably at least twice those considered to be the upper limit beyond which damage is likely to occur (see Hawkins and Roberts, 1997), and that damage, albeit largely unintentional, is occurring but could be controlled by better management measures (Jadot and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the decommissioning of offshore installations, significant numbers of disused installations are being used to create artificial reefs.

In 2016, it was estimated that some 600 offshore installations would be decommissioned between 2017 and 2021.

Results indicate that “muck diving” tourism is worth more than $150 million annually in Indonesia and the Philippines combined.

Over the same period, catches of pinnipeds and other cetaceans in the northern hemisphere have remained relatively stable overall (North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), 2019; International Whaling Commission (IWC), 2019). Catches of baleen whales in the western North Pacific have remained broadly stable since the first Assessment (IWC, 2019, catches taken under special permits) and catches in Antarctic waters were suspended in 2019 (IWC, 2019). Regulated subsistence hunting of marine mammals remains stable (NAMMCO, 2019; IWC, 2019). Two intergovernmental organizations continue to provide a forum for discussions on and the assessment and management of catches of marine mammals: IWC, established in 1946, and NAMMCO, established in 1992.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBy-caught marine mammals can complement fishery catches for human consumption. This practice can be further complemented by hunting or the use of stranded animals in some countries (Robards and Reeves, 2011). Marine mammals used in such a way has been termed “aquatic wild meat” or “marine bushmeat”, the latter as an analogy with terrestrial bushmeat used to support food security in deprived regions (Cosentino and Fisher, 2016; Clapham and Van Waerebeek, 2007). The catch and consumption of coastal species in lower latitudes are likely to have increased (Robards and Reeves, 2011), in particular in South-East Asia and West Africa (Porter and Lai, 2017; Liu and others, 2019; Mintzer and others, 2018; Van Waerebeek and others, 2017), where the sustainability of such practices is often unknown. As habitat change associated with climate change redistributes species and has a potential impact on population abundances (Moore and Reeves, 2018), communities relying on the harvesting of marine mammals for food are also likely to be affected, resulting in future food security challenges (Brinkman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine mammals remain culturally significant, with objects created from body parts and as part of the imagery of coastal traditions and cultures.

The distribution of consumption per capita varies considerably, from Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean (9.7 kg) to Asia (21.6 kg), North America (21.8), Europe (22.0 kg) and Oceania (25.4 kg).

This is still considerably lower than in more developed regions, even though the gap is narrowing. A sizeable share of fish consumed in developed countries consists of imports and, owing to steady demand and declining domestic fishery production (down 22 per cent in the period 1992-2012), their dependence on imports, in particular from developing countries, is projected to grow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFAO estimates indicate that small-scale fisheries contribute about half of global fish catches.

As well as direct consumption, many small-scale fishermen sell or barter their catch. It is doubtful that much of that trade is covered by official statistics. However, studies have shown that selling or trading even a portion of their catch represents as much as one third of the total income of subsistence fishermen in some low-income countries.

In other areas, however, studies continue to suggest that the interaction of divers with coral is damaging the reefs. A recent study of the coral reefs around the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean part of the Netherlands showed that diving is at levels probably at least twice those considered to be the upper limit beyond which damage is likely to occur (see Hawkins and Roberts, 1997), and that damage, albeit largely unintentional, is occurring but could be controlled by better management measures (Jadot and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the decommissioning of offshore installations, significant numbers of disused installations are being used to create artificial reefs.

In 2016, it was estimated that some 600 offshore installations would be decommissioned between 2017 and 2021.

Results indicate that “muck diving” tourism is worth more than $150 million annually in Indonesia and the Philippines combined.

First, there are the economic activities in providing goods and services which are often marketed (fisheries, shipping, communications, tourism and recreation, and so on). Secondly, there are the other tangible ecosystem services which are not part of a market, but which are vital to human life. For example, marine plants (mainly tiny floating diatoms) produce about 50 per cent of atmospheric oxygen. Mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses are also natural carbon sinks. Coastal habitats, including coral reefs, protect homes, communities and businesses from storm surges and wave attack. Thirdly, there are the intangible ecosystem services. We know that the ocean means far more to us than just merely the functional or practical services that it provides. Humans value the ocean in many other ways: for aesthetic, cultural or religious reasons, and for just being there in all its diversity – giving us a “sense of place” (Halpern et al., 2012). Not surprisingly, given the resources that the ocean provides, human settlements have grown up very much near the shore: 38 per cent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the shore, 44 per cent within 150 km, 50 per cent within 200 km, and 67 per cent within 400 km (Small et al 2004).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll these marine ecosystem services have substantial economic value. While there is much debate about valuation methods (and whether some ecosystem services can be valued) and about exact figures, attempts to estimate the value of marine ecosystem services have found such values to be on the order of trillions of US dollars annually (Costanza, et al., 1997). Nearly three-quarters of this value resides in coastal zones (Martínez, et al., 2007). The point is not so much the monetary figure that can be estimated for non-marketed ecosystem services, but rather the fact that people do not need to pay anything for them – these services are nature’s gift to humanity. But we take these services for granted at our peril, because the cost of replacing them, if it were possible to do so, would be immense and in many cases, incalculable.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,4," How"],["B2539","2","What can human disturbance do to species?","O que a perturbação humana pode causar às espécies?","What is the main impact of human activities on marine biodiversity?","Qual é o principal impacto das atividades humanas na biodiversidade marinha?","To raise the level of species mortality","Elevar o nível de mortalidade das espécies","Direct death, introduction of invasive predators,  disturbance of beaches where eggs are laid or direct human disturbance from tourism","Morte direta, introdução de predadores invasores, perturbação das praias onde os ovos são colocados ou perturbação humana direta do turismo","","\u003ch1\u003eCumulative impacts of human activities on marine biodiversity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eMarine mammals, marine reptiles, seabirds, sharks, tuna and billfis\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCumulative effects are comparatively well documented for species groups of the top predators in the ocean, including marine mammals, seabirds and marine reptiles.

Some of those species are the subject of direct harvesting, particularly some pinnipeds (seals and related species) and seabirds, and by-catch in fisheries can be a significant mortality source for many species. However, in addition to having to sustain the impact of those direct deaths, all of those species suffer from varying levels of exposure to pollution from land-based sources and increasing levels of noise in the ocean. Land-nesting seabirds, marine turtles and pinnipeds also face habitat disturbance, such as through the introduction of invasive predators on isolated breeding islands, the disturbance of beaches where eggs are laid or direct human disturbance from tourism, including ecotourism.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSome global measures have been helpful in addressing specific sources of mortality, such as the global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing called for by the General Assembly in 1991, which was a major step in limiting the by-catch of several marine mammal and seabird species that were especially vulnerable to entanglement. However, for seabirds alone, at least 10 different pressures have been identified that can affect a single population throughout its annual cycle, with efforts to mitigate one pressure sometimes increasing vulnerability to others.

The impacts of these changes are discussed in the next Section.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in the rates of freshwater exchange between the ocean, atmosphere and continents have additional significant impacts. For example, spatial variations in the distribution of evaporation and precipitation create gradients in salinity and heat that in turn drive ocean circulation; ocean freshening also affects ecosystem structure. These aspects and their impacts are discussed in Sections 3 and 4.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother factor potentially contributing to regional changes in the hydrological cycle are changes in ocean surface currents. For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2467","2","What was the growth rate of aquaculture in the pre-2000s?","Qual era a taxa de crescimento da aquicultura antes dos anos 2000?","What is the growth rate of aquaculture in the years prior to 2000?","Qual a taxa de crescimento da aquicultura nos anos anteriores à 2000?","The growth rate was over 10%","A taxa de crescimento era superior a 10%","11.3 in 1980s and 10.0 per cent in 1990s","11,3% nos anos 80 e 10% nos anos 90","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eGlobal aquaculture production in 2017 (animals and plants) was recorded as 111.9 million tons, with an estimated firstsale value of $249.6 billion.

Nevertheless, it continues to grow at a faster rate than other major food production sectors. Annual growth declined to a moderate 5.8  per  cent during the period from 2000 to 2016, although double-digit growth still occurred in a small number of countries, in particular in Africa, from 2006 to 2010.

The Agreement is aimed at strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is recognized in the Agreement that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation of all countries.

Today 44 per cent of the world's population lives on or within 150 kilometres from the coast (United Nations Atlas of Oceans). However this fundamental connection between nature and people has only very recently been incorporated into trans-disciplinary thinking on how we manage and account for the human benefits we get from nature. Today, when a product taken from an ecosystem1 , for example, fibres, timber or fish, enters the economic cycle (i.e., a part of the human system), it receives a monetary value that accounts at least for the costs associated with its extraction and mobilization. If that natural product is the result of cultivation, as in the case of agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, the monetary value also includes the production costs. However, the extraction of natural products and other human benefits from ecosystems has implicit costs of production and other ancillary costs associated with preserving the integrity of the natural production system itself. Traditionally these benefits and costs have been hidden within the “natural system,” and are not accounted for financially; such hidden costs and benefits are considered “externalities” by neoclassical economists. While the neoclassical economic toolbox includes non-market valuation approaches, an ecosystem services approach emphasizes that ‘price’ is not equal to “value” and highlights human well-being, as a normative goal. The emergence and evolution of the ecosystem services concept offers an explicit attempt to better capture and reflect these hidden or unaccounted benefits and associated costs when the natural “production” system is negatively affected by human activities. The ecosystem services approach has proven to be very useful in the management of multi-sector processes and already informs many management and regulatory processes around the world (e.g. United Kingdom National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,3," What"],["B2570","2","What is the main product of photosynthesis?","Qual o principal produto da fotossíntese?","What is the outcome from photosynthesis process through Hotspots for primary productivity ?","Qual é o resultado do processo de fotossíntese através de \"pontos quentes\" para produtividade primária ?","Oxygen","Oxigênio","Oxygen.","Oxigênio","","\u003ch1\u003ePatterns of biodiversity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eLocation of biodiversity hotspots and their relationship to the location of high levels of ecosystem services\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough marine life is found everywhere in the ocean, biodiversity hotspots exist where the number of species and the concentration of biotas are consistently high relative to adjacent areas. Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean. The areas supporting high relative and absolute levels of biodiversity not only harbour unique species adapted to their special features, but also often serve as centres for essential life-history stages of species with wider distributions. For example, essentially all the biodiversity hotspots that have been identified have also been found to harbour juvenile fish, which are important for fisheries in adjacent areas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eHotspots for primary productivity are necessarily also hotspots for production of oxygen as a direct result of photosynthesis. Furthermore, underlying the high biodiversity is often a high structural complexity of the habitats that support it. That structure often contributes other services, such as coastal protection and regeneration. In addition, it is the concentrated presence of iconic species in an area which adds to aesthetic services (supporting tourism and recreation) and spiritual and cultural services.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2264","2","What can be done to decrease the risk that algae toxins are found in commercial seafood?","O que pode ser feito para diminuir o risco de que as toxinas das algas sejam encontradas em frutos do mar comerciais? \n\n ","What can be done to reduce the risk that algae toxins will be found in commercial seafood?","Quais ações podem ser tomadas para minimizar o risco de que toxinas de algas sejam encontradas em frutos do mar comercializados?","Implementation of control and management programs based on rigorous research both in the validation of methods and in the understanding of the temporal and spatial behavior of toxic algae.","implantação de programas de controle e gerenciamento baseados em pesquisas rigorosas tanto na validação dos métodos quanto no entendimento do comportamento temporal e espacial das algas tóxicas.","Effective monitoring and management programmes in place in some “at-risk” regions","Programas eficazes de monitoramento e gestão em vigor em regiões de risco","","human health risk (Chang and others, 2020; Galloway and others, 2017; Mossman and others, 2007; Numan and others, 2015; Sforzini and others, 2020; Smith and others, 2018; Stapleton, 2019; Stern and others, 2012; Vethaak and Leslie, 2016; Von Moos and others, 2012). Combustion nanoparticles are taken up into cells by endocytosis and accumulate in lysosomes, where overloading of the lysosomes results in membrane permeabilization, with resultant release of intralysosomal iron that causes oxidative cell injury leading to oxidative stress, with subsequent tissue and organ damage (Moore, 2020; Numan and others, 2015; Stern and others, 2012; Sforzini and others, 2020; Von Moos and others, 2012). There are now concerns that other nanoparticles including nano- and microplastics, may behave in a similar way (Boverhof and others, 2015; Von Moos and others, 2012).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eShellfish are the major vector of illnesses caused by pathogens discharged to the sea. Oysters, for example, can concentrate such pathogens up to 99 times the level in their surrounding water (Burkhardt and Calci, 2000; Morris and Acheson, 2003; Motes and others, 1994; Vezzulli and others, 2016). The most common viral pathogens involved were norovirus (83.7 per cent) and the hepatitis A virus (12.8  per  cent) (Bellou and others, 2013). No global database exists on outbreaks of illness of that kind. However, a survey of outbreaks reported between 1980 and 2012 found records of about 368  shellfish-borne viral outbreaks. The majority were located in East Asia, with more than half in Japan, followed by Europe, the Americas, Oceania and Africa. In addition to sewage-borne pathogens, toxins (e.g., yessotoxins, brevetoxins and ciguatoxins) can be produced by toxic algae (e.g., dinoflagellates), often at relatively low concentrations (e.g., 200 cells/l of Alexandrium spp.) and not necessarily restricted to algal blooms (see chap. 10 for causes of such blooms; and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases). Algal toxins can enter the food web and are often present in shellfish and fish where they can cause illness as a result of their consumption as human food. The health impacts of algal toxins are not limited to illnesses and deaths caused by poisoning, but also include health impacts from the loss of shellfish and other fisheries that have to be closed to protect people from poisoning, and the disruption of ecosystems caused by deaths of fish and top predators that ingest the algae or the toxins that they produce. Many toxic algal bloom events are reported annually, from all parts of the world, and the number is growing. The increased numbers are, in part, attributable to improved observation and recording, but there is reliable evidence demonstrating a real increase in the incidence of such problem blooms as a result of the interaction of many factors, including rising sea temperatures, increased inputs of nutrients to the ocean, the transfer of non-indigenous species by shipping, and changes in the balance of nutrients in the sea (Hinder and others, 2012). Health warning systems could be implemented in higher risk areas by involving not only the public health authorities, but also community planners, utility managers and designers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEffective monitoring and management programmes are, however, in place in some “at-risk” regions to prevent such toxins from being found in commercial seafood (Anderson, 2009; Anderson and others, 2001; see chap. 10). Such programmes are based on rigorous research on method development and validation, as well as the understanding of temporal and spatial patterns of toxic algae and knowledge of their transfer to humans.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eToxic algal blooms are complex phenomena, and many different disciplines need to be involved in finding a way to address the problems they cause, ranging from molecular and cell biology to large-scale field surveys, numerical modelling and remote sensing (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IOC), 2017). Other biogenic toxins of health concern, which are not produced by algal blooms, include cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria, tetrodotoxins produced by symbiotic bacteria, which are used by metazoans as a defensive biotoxin to ward off predation or as both a defensive and predatory venom, and palytoxins, which are intense vasoconstrictors that pose risks to humans primarily through exposure to coral (Bane and others, 2014; Ramos and Vasconcelos, 2010; Zanchett and Oliveira-Filho, 2013). Humans who consume shellfish contaminated with brevetoxins, which are produced by some species of plankton, are at high risk of developing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. There are also reports of skin ailments resulting from contact with brevetoxin-contaminated water and of respiratory illness from brevetoxin aerosols, in particular in vulnerable people with asthma (Hoagland and others, 2009). Shellfish metabolites of brevetoxin can also show different patterns of toxicity (Turner and others, 2015). Tetrodotoxins, produced by some species of bacteria, and ciguatoxins, produced by some species of plankton, can accumulate in fish and other seafood and are poisonous when consumed. Those types of biogenic toxins were previously associated with tropical waters but are now being found in temperate zones (Rodriguez and others, 2008; Silva and others, 2015a, 2015b). The social costs of all those illnesses can be huge, and the estimated costs related to illnesses from toxic algal blooms in just one single county in Florida, United States, amounted to between $0.5 million and $4.0 million (Hoagland and others, 2009).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,false,3,5,4," What"],["B2000","2"," Some regions are more predominant among the crews, which are the top three regions?

It seems likely that many of the major cargo-carrying operators were making a loss in 2012, as a result of overcapacity resulting from the general economic recession. On the other hand, cruise operators reported profits. According to estimates by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, owners from five countries (China, Germany, Greece, Japan and the Republic of Korea) together accounted for 53 per cent of the world tonnage in 2013.

Thus, investment, along with a focus on biosecurity and health, have been on the increase worldwide (Subasinghe and others, 2019). Biosecurity in aquaculture consists of practices that minimize the risk of introducing an infectious disease and spreading it to the animals at a facility and the risk that diseased animals or infectious agents will leave a facility and spread disease to other sites and to other susceptible species. These practices also reduce stress on the animals, thus making them less susceptible to disease.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe long list of aquatic diseases and pathogens includes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, which recently devastated shrimp aquaculture in Asian countries (e.g. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand).

Revenue loss due to the disease in South-East Asia has been estimated at over $4 billion. Countries must monitor other emerging diseases, such as Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in shrimps and tilapia lake virus (Tilapia tilapinevirus), which could potentially have a severe impact on the sector if not addressed in a timely manner (FAO, 2017a). New molecular diagnostic tools are now being applied to the identification of disease agents and their distribution patterns in hatchery, farmed and wild fishes throughout the world.

In 2012, international tourism expenditure exceeded 1 billion dollars for the first time. Total expenditure on tourism, domestic as well as international, is several times that amount. The direct turnover of tourism contributed 2.9 per cent of gross world product in 2013, rising to 8.9 per cent when the multiplier effect on the rest of the economy is taken into account. The Middle East is the region where tourism plays the smallest part in the economy (6.4 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect), and the Caribbean is the region where it plays the largest part (13.9 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMost reports of tourism revenues do not differentiate revenues from tourism directly related to the sea and the coast from other types of tourism. Even where tourism in the coastal zone can be separated from tourism inland, it may be generated by the attractions of the sea and coast or its maritime history, as it may be based on other attractions not linked to the marine environment. Consequently, the value of ocean-related tourism is a matter of inference. However, coastal tourism is a major component of tourism everywhere. In small island and coastal States, coastal tourism is usually predominant because it can only take place in the coastal zone in those countries. Particularly noteworthy is the way in which international tourism is increasing in Asia and the Pacific, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of world tourism.

The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States.

Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",true,true,1,3,5," What"],["B2145","2","How many fish species from New Zealand are estimated to have not yet been discovered?","Estima-se que quantas espécies de peixes da Nova Zelândia ainda não foram descobertas?","What is the estimate of New Zealand fish species that have not yet been discovered?","Qual a estimativa de espécies de peixes da Nova Zelândia que ainda não foram descobertas?","At least 700 species","Ao menos 700 espécies","At least 700 fish species.

However, the global extinction of the smooth handfish Sympterichthys unipennis (Last and others, 2020) is a reminder that fish biodiversity continues to face significant threats as well. Both positive and negative outcomes are known because fishes continue to be among the most systematically studied and monitored components of marine ecosystems, mostly because of their economic value. Nonetheless, considerable fish diversity remains to be discovered: expert estimates indicate that at least another 700 fish species (approximately a 50 per cent increase over the number of currently known species) are yet to be described from the New Zealand exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf alone (Gordon and others, 2010; Roberts and others, 2019). Further increase in capacity in taxonomy and biosystematics (Taxonomy Decadal Plan Working Group, 2018) and the integration of data from existing biodiversity collections (Nelson and others, 2015) and other sources (Edgar and others, 2016) would pave the way for more comprehensive, synthetic analyses of fish biodiversity over the near to medium term. In addition to improving our understanding of fish biodiversity, improved estimates of fish biomass are needed for some ocean zones, such as the pelagic zone. While it is estimated that mesopelagic fishes dominate global fish biomass, estimates of their biomass span several orders of magnitude and, therefore, the exact contribution that this group makes to global patterns remains poorly understood (Irigoien and others, 2014; Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). In addition, while there are no current estimates of species richness or biomass of bathypelagic fishes, which reside in the world’s largest environment (in terms of volume), it is highly likely that those fishes constitute a large portion of global fish biomass (Sutton and others, 2017). Since the first Assessment, the disposal of deep-sea mining water after ore removal has emerged as a significant threat to bathypelagic fishes (Drazen and others, 2019).

Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOverexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,1," How"],["B2202","2","How are visual feeding species affected by low-oxygen water areas?","Como as áreas de água com baixo oxigênio afetam as espécies de alimentação visual?","How low-oxygen water areas can influence visual feeding species?","Como regiões de água com baixa concentração de oxigênio influenciam as espécies de peixe com alimentação visual?","They're forced into shallower waters with higher light levels, above low oxygen zones.","Elas são forçadas a entrar em águas mais rasas com níveis de luz mais altos, acima das zonas de baixo oxigênio.

Food webs change because of altered encounter rates and the species-specific effects of low oxygen on the feeding efficiencies of predators and escape behaviours of prey. Energy transfer to tolerant animals, such as gelatinous species, can increase (Keister and Tuttle, 2013). The roles of vision (McCormick and Levin, 2017) and carnivory (Sperling and others, 2016) can decline within low oxygen areas because those activities are energy intensive. In contrast, predation can intensify above low oxygen zones as visual feeders are forced into shallower waters with higher light levels (Koslow and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDeclining ocean oxygen is expected to negatively affect a wide range of biological and ecological processes. The magnitude of the effects will vary among species and processes, however, and whether the magnitude of responses will be directly proportional to the magnitude of oxygen decline is uncertain. Some effects of oxygen decline are dependent on direct exposure within low-oxygen waters, while others involve the movement of organisms and material (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, greenhouse gases) among locations that vary in oxygen content, and still other effects are primarily dependent on oxygen levels at particular locations that are critical for a species or life stage. Many responses involve threshold oxygen levels at which biological functions can no longer be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biomass and diversity of eukaryotic organisms tend to decline and species composition changes as oxygen declines (Gallo and Levin, 2016). As low-oxygen waters expand, tolerant species can expand their depth range, while ranges of species that are more sensitive contract (Sato and others, 2017). The relative abundance of species within systems reflects variation in species’ tolerances to low oxygen and other co-stressors (Koslow and others, 2018). Organisms, including crustaceans and fish adapted to low-oxygen environments, can reach very high densities in low-oxygen areas (Pineda and others, 2016; Gallo and others, 2019). However, in naturally low-oxygen habitats, such as oxygen minimum zones, even very small changes (representing less than 1  per  cent of the oxygen content of well-oxygenated surface waters) can result in the exclusion of species that would otherwise be abundant (Wishner and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,5," How"],["B2229","2","Which are the main vectors that cause damage to marine biodiversity and to the quality of its environment?","Quais são os principais vetores que trazem prejuízos para a biodiversidade marinha e para a qualidade deste ambiente ?","Which are the main drivers of pressure on marine biodiversity and on marine environment quality?","Quais são os principais fatores de pressão sobre a biodiversidade marítima e a qualidade do ambiente marinho?","Demand for food from population, international trade in agricultural and industrial products, and coastal degradation from land-based development and land-based sources.","Demanda por comida da população, comércio internacional de produtos da agricultura e indústria, e degradação costeira oriunda do desenvolvimento terrestre e de fontes terrestres.","The demand for food for terrestrial populations, the international trade and the coastal degradation from land-based development.","A demanda por comida das populações terrestres, o comércio internacional e a degradação costeira pelo desenvolvimento em terra.","","\u003ch1\u003eIntegrated management of human activities affecting the ocean\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regular Process is to provide an assessment of all the aspects of the marine environment relevant to sustainable development: environmental, economic and social. Even though the marine environment covers seven tenths of the planet, it is still only one component of the overall Earth system. As far as environmental aspects are concerned, major drivers of the pressures producing change in the ocean are to be found outside the marine environment. In particular, most of the major drivers of anthropogenic climate change are land-based. Likewise, the main drivers of increased pressures on marine biodiversity and marine environmental quality include the demand for food for terrestrial populations, international trade in products from land-based agriculture and industries and coastal degradation from land-based development and land-based sources.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThus, as far as social and economic aspects of the marine environment are concerned, many of the most significant drivers are outside the scope of the present Assessment. For example, the levels of cargo shipping are driven mainly by world trade, which is determined by demand and supply for raw materials and finished products. The extent of cruising and other types of tourism is determined by the levels around the world of disposable income and leisure time. The patterns of trade in fish and other seafood and in cultural goods from the ocean are set by the location of supply and demand and the relative purchasing power of local markets as compared with international ones, modified by national and international rules on the exploitation of those resources. A wide range of factors outside the marine environment are thus relevant to policymaking for the marine environment.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,3,5,2," What"],["B2166","2","What is an example of a bay where the development of the coast was not well planned and led to negative impacts on its marine fauna and flora?","Qual é um exemplo de baia onde o desenvolvimento da costa não foi bem planejado e levou a impactos negativos na sua fauna e flora marinha?","What is an example of a bay where coastal development was poorly planned and negatively impacted its marine life forms?","Qual é um exemplo de baía onde o desenvolvimento costeiro foi mal planejado e impactou negativamente suas formas de vida marinha?","The Vlora Bay in Albania","A baía de Vlora, na Albânia.","Vlora Bay in Albania","A baía de Vlora na Albânia","","\u003ch1\u003eImpacts on the marine environment\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all tourist areas, the major impact on the marine environment comes from coastal development, including the proportion of land covered by buildings, such as hotels, restaurants and retail shops, and transport infrastructure, including ports, airports and train terminals, and the need for hard built coastal defences, street lighting and sewerage (see also chap. 14). Where such development is not subject to effective planning and management, impacts on marine flora and fauna can be disastrous. For example, at Vlora Bay in Albania, unplanned development over 15 years has resulted in the disappearance of 50 per cent of the seagrass meadows and a substantial reduction in macroalgae (Fraschetti and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn tourist regions, beach feeding or beach nourishment, which is the replacement of sand on beaches which have had sand removed by coastal currents or extreme weather events, can have considerable economic benefits (Klein and Osleeb, 2010).

Beach cleaning and the building of sea walls are generally done to give “sun, sea and sand” tourists surroundings that they find more attractive, and they have significant effects on the local flora and fauna, as recorded in the first Assessment. Studies continue to show that beaches used extensively for tourism support ecosystems that are less rich than those of comparable beaches in the same vicinity that are in protected areas, for example, along the New Jersey coast in the United States, (Kelly, 2014) and near Cadiz, Spain (Reyes-Martínez and others, 2015), and that seawalls supported 23 per cent less biodiversity and 45 per cent fewer organisms than natural shorelines (Gittman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOther interventions to attract tourists to beaches have included the creation of artificial surfing reefs.

The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean circulates within these geological structures. This water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the sea water. Salinity varies according to the relativity between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Sea areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, with large amounts of freshwater coming from rivers and relatively low evaporation have low salinity – 8 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively, as compared with the global average of 35 parts per thousand (HELCOM 2010, Black Sea Commission 2008). The Red Sea, in contrast, with low riverine input and high insolation, and therefore high evaporation, has a mean surface salinity as high as 42.5 parts per thousand (Heilman et al 2009). Seawater can also be stratified into separate layers, with different salinities and different temperatures. Such stratification can lead to variations in both the oxygen content and nutrient content, with critical consequences in both cases for the biota dependent on them. A further variation is in the penetration of light. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis of inorganic carbon (mainly CO2) into the organic carbon of plants and mixotrophic species1 . Even clear water reduces the level of light that can penetrate by about 90 per cent for every 75 metres of depth. Below 200 metres depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis (Widder 2014). The upper 200 metres of the ocean are therefore where most photosynthesis takes place (the euphotic zone). Variations in light level in the water column and on the sea bed are caused by seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion. Where turbidity occurs, it can reduce the penetration of light by up to 95 per cent, and thus reduce the level of photosynthesis which can take place (Anthony 2004).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,5,1," What"],["B2317","2","How is marine litter classified?","Como o lixo marinho é classificado?","How is marine debris classified?","Como o detrito marinho pode ser classificado?","By the nature of the material, such as plastic, metal, glass, rubber or wood, or by sources or uses, such as fishing gear, industrial pellets, sanitary items and single-use plastics.","Pela natureza do material, como plástico, metal, vidro, borracha ou madeira, ou por fontes ou usos, como artes de pesca, pellets industriais, sanitários e plásticos descartáveis.","By the nature of the material, by sources or by uses.","Pela natureza do material, por fonte ou por uso.","","\u003ch1\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe term “marine litter” refers to any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in marine and coastal environments (Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP), 2019) and covers an extremely wide variety of materials, ranging in size from mega-litter (\u003e 1 m), to macro-litter (\u003e 25 mm), meso-litter (\u003e 5 mm), micro-litter (\u003e 1 µm) and nano-litter (\u003c 1 µm). It is classified by the nature of the material, such as plastic, metal, glass, rubber or wood, or by sources or uses, such as fishing gear, industrial pellets, sanitary items and single-use plastics. Plastic, defined as polymers synthesized from hydrocarbon molecules or biomass with thermoplastic or thermoset properties, comprises the main component of marine litter and exhibits a wide range of properties, shapes and compositions (GESAMP, 2016). In 2018, approximately 348 million tons of plastic waste had been generated worldwide (PlasticsEurope, 2019), with annual amounts entering the ocean in the range of 4.8 to 12.7 million tons, based on data from 2010 (Jambeck and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMarine litter is most obvious on shorelines, where it accumulates from water currents, wave and wind action and river outflows.

Sophisticated techniques now make it possible to drill multiple wells from a single drilling platform, while advances in real-time fibre-optic monitoring of the well bore is optimizing the reservoir performance and mitigating equipment failure risks (Beaubouef, 2019). Similarly, the use of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools is enhancing data analysis for detecting equipment breakdown and improving operational efficiency (Husseini, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of FPSO vessels enables drilling in areas further offshore and without ready access to a pipeline network to transport oil and gas onshore. It has also opened previously inaccessible hostile environments, in particular in the higher latitudes and in the Arctic, to exploration and development. FPSO vessels are equipped to store hydrocarbons onboard and periodically transfer their load to tankers for transportation onshore. They can also disconnect from their moorings in case of adverse weather conditions, such as cyclones and hurricanes. Once the reservoirs are depleted, an FPSO vessel can be redeployed to a new prospective site. The global market for FPSO vessels is currently boosted by large investments in deepwater exploration and development in such areas as the coast of Brazil (Rystad Energy, 2019). Meanwhile, FPSO vessel design is evolving to enhance safety, minimize complexity and reduce fabrication and operation costs (Barton, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch technological advances have enabled exploration and production at uncharted depths and distance from shore.

This proportion is steadily increasing. Consequently, there are growing demands for land in the coastal zone. Land reclamation has therefore been taking place on a large scale in many countries, particularly by reclaiming salt marshes, intertidal flats and mangroves. At the same time, where coastal land is threatened by erosion, large stretches of natural coastline have been replaced by “armoured”, artificial coastal structures. Those can significantly affect coastal currents and the ability of marine biotas to use the coast as part of their habitat. Tourist developments have also significantly increased the lengths of artificial coastline. Changes in river management, such as the construction of dams, and the building of coastal infrastructures, such as ports, can significantly change the sedimentation pattern along coasts. Such changes can increase coastal erosion and promote other coastal changes, sometimes with the effect that coastal land is lost for its current use, producing demands for replacement space.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,3," What"],["B2525","2"," \nWhat are the main freshwater flows to the ocean?","Quais os principais fluxos de água doce para o oceano?","What are the main freshwater flows that fill the ocean?","Quais são os principais fluxos de água doce que enchem o oceano?","Direct flow from continental rivers and lakes; groundwater infiltration; runoff, melting of submarines and formation of icebergs from polar ice sheets; melting sea ice; and direct precipitation mainly rain, but also includes snowfall.","Escoamento direto de rios e lagos continentais; infiltração da água subterrânea; escoamento, derretimento de submarinos e formação de icebergs das camadas de gelo polares; derretimento do gelo marinho; e precipitação direta, principalmente chuva, mas também inclui queda de neve.","Precipitation and runoff from rivers and lakes are the most significant factors.","A precipitação e o escoamento de rios e lagos são os mais fatores significativos.","","\u003cp\u003eThe global ocean covers 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface, and contains 97 per cent of all the surface water on Earth (Costello et al., 2010).

Today 44 per cent of the world's population lives on or within 150 kilometres from the coast (United Nations Atlas of Oceans). However this fundamental connection between nature and people has only very recently been incorporated into trans-disciplinary thinking on how we manage and account for the human benefits we get from nature. Today, when a product taken from an ecosystem1 , for example, fibres, timber or fish, enters the economic cycle (i.e., a part of the human system), it receives a monetary value that accounts at least for the costs associated with its extraction and mobilization. If that natural product is the result of cultivation, as in the case of agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, the monetary value also includes the production costs. However, the extraction of natural products and other human benefits from ecosystems has implicit costs of production and other ancillary costs associated with preserving the integrity of the natural production system itself. Traditionally these benefits and costs have been hidden within the “natural system,” and are not accounted for financially; such hidden costs and benefits are considered “externalities” by neoclassical economists. While the neoclassical economic toolbox includes non-market valuation approaches, an ecosystem services approach emphasizes that ‘price’ is not equal to “value” and highlights human well-being, as a normative goal. The emergence and evolution of the ecosystem services concept offers an explicit attempt to better capture and reflect these hidden or unaccounted benefits and associated costs when the natural “production” system is negatively affected by human activities. The ecosystem services approach has proven to be very useful in the management of multi-sector processes and already informs many management and regulatory processes around the world (e.g. United Kingdom National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,3,4," What"],["B2483","2","What problems can be caused by the increased circulation of ships in the Arctic?","Quais problemas podem ser causados com o aumento da circulação de navios no artico?","What the increased circulation of ships in the Arctic can cause to its marine environment?","O que a crescente circulação de navios no Ártico pode causar ao seu ambiente marinho?","They can cause acute disasters, such as chronic pollution and the potential introduction of invasive non-native species, in addition to oil pollution.","Podem causar desastres agudos, como a poluição crônica e a introdução potencial de espécies não nativas invasivas, além da poluição causada pelo óleo.","The movement of species between the Pacific and the Atlantic, marine pollution and introduction of invasive non-native species.","A circulação de espécies entre o Pacífico e o Atlântico, a poluição marinha e a introdução de espécies invasoras não-nativas.","","\u003ch1\u003eImpacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eSubmarine cables\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSubmarine cables have always been at risk of breaks from submarine landslides, mainly at the edge of the continental shelf.

The movement of species between the Pacific and the Atlantic demonstrates the scale of the potential impact. Those routes are shorter and may be more economic, but shipping brings with it increased risks of marine pollution both from acute disasters and chronic pollution and the potential introduction of invasive non-native species. The very low rate at which bacteria can break down spilled oil in polar conditions and the general low recovery rate of polar ecosystems mean that damage from such pollution would be very serious. Furthermore, the response and clear-up infrastructure found in other ocean basins is largely lacking today around the Arctic Ocean. Those factors would make such problems even worse.

Growth in the first half of 2019 stood at 1 per cent, the weakest level since 2012 (IMF, 2019). Economic growth, when averaged across the global population (with vast geographical variability in economic growth, as noted in sect. 3), has resulted in the average annual income of an individual increasing from $3,300 in 1950 to $14,574 in 2016.

At the same time, primary energy intensity, an indicator of how much energy is used by the global economy, slowed from 1.7 per cent in 2017 to 1.2 per cent in 2019 (IEA, 2019a). The slowing of efficiencies (i.e., the amount of GDP generated for the amount of energy used) is the result of a number of short-term factors, such as growth in fossil fuel-based electricity generation, and longer-term structural changes, such as a slowing transition towards less energy-intensive industries. At the same time, investment targeting energy efficiencies has been stable since 2014. Improvements in technical efficiency reduced energy-related carbon emissions by 3.5 gigatons of CO2 between 2015 and 2018 (IEA, 2019a). In addition, renewable energy production has grown as many countries shift to energy strategies that rely on it as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean energy production is part of many strategic developments and grew from 1 TWh (Terawatt hour) in 2014 to 1.2 TWh in 2018 (IEA, 2019b).

Over 80 per cent of the tourists land on Antarctica (International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), 2018). Passenger landings and marine traffic are highly concentrated at a few specific locations, in particular along the Antarctic Peninsula’s south-western coast. Growth in Antarctic tourism is closely correlated with the economies of the countries sending the most visitors to the region: 60 per cent of the tourists come from the United States (33 per cent), China (16 per cent) and Australia (11 per cent). The proportion of tourists from China increased significantly between 2013 and 2014 and between 2017 and 2018. Markets for Antarctic travel are probably far from saturated, and demand is therefore likely to continue to grow (Bender and others, 2016).

Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOverexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,false,5,3,4," Why"],["B2520","2","What is the main source of marine litter?","Qual é a principal fonte de lixo marinho?","where does most marine litter come from?","De onde vem a maior parte do lixo marinho?","Most litter is land-based.","A maior parte do lixo é terrestre.","Plastics","Plásticos","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003ePlastics now represent the major share of marine litter or marine debris.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eMost marine litter is from land-based sources, resulting from poor waste management practices, especially in some rural and developing regions.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eMarine litter is present in all marine habitats, affecting the environment and marine organisms through entanglement, ingestion and the rafting of invasive species.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eAmounts of marine litter are increasing in remote and unpopulated areas.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eTime series data are needed to assess and monitor impacts of marine litter, including microplastics and nanoplastics.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eAlthough a decreasing trend is observed, there is a need to harmonize reporting on dumping at sea.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e ",false,true,3,5,1," What"],["B2091","2","By what means can ecosystem-based management aid marine environment preservation?","Por quais meios a gestão baseada em ecossistema pode dar auxílio à preservação de ambientes marinhos?","How can ecosystem-based management aid marine environment preservation?","Como uma gestão baseada em ecossistema pode dar auxílio à preservação de ambientes marinhos?","By supporting the identification of solutions which prevent and mitigate ecosystem pressures caused by cumulative effects resulting from the interaction among human activities and natural events.","Dando suporte à identificação de soluções para evitar e mitigar pressões no ecossistema causadas por efeitos cumulativos resultantes da interação entre atividades humanas e eventos naturais.","By balancing human activities with environmental stewardship.","Por balancear as atividades humanas com supervisão ambiental.","","\u003cp\u003eThe marine environment is currently subject to a number of pressures, many of which are derived from human activities. They include climate change, the extraction of resources, pollution (from land and marine sources) and invasive species, resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease (e.g., Evans and others, 2017). The aim of ecosystem-based management is to balance human activities with environmental stewardship in order to maintain ecosystem properties, functions and services. That requires an appreciation of how and to what extent human activities and natural events interact and affect ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by such interactions (Halpern and others, 2008; Levin and others, 2009; Ban and others, 2010; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010). Those interactions are known as cumulative impacts or cumulative effects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms “cumulative impacts” and “cumulative effects” are often used interchangeably to describe how pressures affect ecosystems. The use of standardized language is key to the transfer of knowledge, assessment approaches and expertise across management boundaries and among stakeholders and organizations. A preference for the use of the term “cumulative effects” has been identified, noting that impacts are hypothesized and have been either not directly observed or attributed (Murray and others, 2015). For consistency, the term “cumulative effects” is used in the present chapter. There is as yet no universally accepted definition of cumulative effects and impacts, with definitions varying in the literature, depending on what is being assessed, and the context within which the assessment is being undertaken (e.g., Anthony, 2016; Spaling and Smit, 1993; Hegmann and others, 1999; Halpern and others, 2008; Johnson, 2016; Uthicke and others, 2016). The present chapter follows the premise that effects can be defined as a change to the environment, including its human components, while impacts represent the consequences of such change (Johnson, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four general types of cumulative effects: additive, synergistic, antagonistic (compensatory) and masking (Sonntag and others, 1987; Hegmann and others, 1999; Crain and others, 2008; Halpern and others, 2008). Additive effects are incremental additions to the pressures caused by an activity, with each increment adding to previous increments over time. Synergistic effects, also referred to as amplifying or exponential effects, magnify the consequences of individual pressures to produce a joint consequence that is greater than the additive effect. Antagonistic or compensatory effects produce a joint consequence that is less than additive. Masking effects produce essentially the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the pressures alone. Impacts that can be considered cumulative may result from a single activity that repeatedly produces a single pressure, a single activity that produces multiple pressures, multiple activities that produce a single pressure or multiple activities that produce multiple pressures over time (Foley and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,4,5,1," What"],["B2462","2","Which is the main factor that may cause artificial coastal barriers to lose effectiveness in the following years?","Qual o principal fator que pode contribuir à perda de eficácia das barreiras costeiras artificiais nos próximos anos?","What is the main factor that could cause artificial coastal barriers to lose effectiveness in the coming years?","Qual é o principal fator que pode fazer com que as barreiras costeiras artificiais percam eficácia nos próximos anos?","The continuous increase of the average global sea level and its rate of change.","O aumento contínuo do nível médio do mar global e sua taxa de variação.","The rise of the sea level.","A elevação do nível do mar.","","\u003ch1\u003eSea level rise and cities\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCities located along coastlines and in archipelagic and island States are becoming increasingly susceptible to erosion and sea level rise (De Sherbinin and others, 2007; Hanson and others, 2011; Takagi and others, 2016). Many comprise large areas of reclaimed land (the gain of land from the sea, wetlands or other water bodies), which is retained and protected from erosion by hard engineered structures, such as sea walls and rock armouring (Sengupta and others, 2018). It is likely that many of such engineered coastlines will need to be adapted and upgraded to keep pace with rising sea levels. In highly urbanized environments that are often already heavily degraded, hard engineered structures are often the only option available and are considered to be successful options (Hallegatte and others, 2013; Hinkel and others, 2014), but there are a wide range of broader negative impacts of land reclamation and those structures on the surrounding environment (Dafforn and others, 2015). Globally, many regions (especially cities) are claiming that more than 50 per cent of their coastlines are armoured (e.g., Chapman, 2003; Burt and others, 2013), and that number will likely rise in the future in response to burgeoning economies, coastal populations and urbanization (e.g., see plans for the reclamation of the entire coastlines of two Malaysian states in Chee and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an alternative to hard engineered coastal defences, construction of which is complex and expensive, where possible, natural coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes should be used as natural barriers or combined with hard infrastructure using hybrid approaches (Temmerman and others, 2013). The use of such ecosystems can not only protect the land but also provide valuable ecosystem functions and services. As hard engineered coastal defences may be considered an effective short-term solution to coastal flooding, more investment will be needed owing to observed increasing storminess and sea level rise (Mendelsohn and others, 2012; Vitousek and others, 2017). By 2010, the global average sea level was calculated to be 52.4 mm above the 1993 level and, by 2018, it had risen to 89.9 mm above the 1993 level (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2019). The rate of change is also increasing. For the period 1993–2018, the rate of increase was calculated at 3.2 mm per year, while for the period 2010–2018, it was calculated to be much faster, at 4.7 mm per year. Despite significant uncertainties remaining, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea level rise will continue for centuries, even if mitigation measures are put in place. The potential widespread collapse of ice shelves could lead to a larger twenty-first century sea level rise of up to several tenths of a metre (Church and others, 2013), which will have drastic consequences for coastal, archipelagic and small island cities, in particular those in low-lying areas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eUrbanization could, however, also provide opportunities for risk reduction, given that cities are engines of economic growth and centres of innovation, political attention and private sector investments (Garschagen and Romero-Lankao, 2015). Hallegatte and others (2013) conducted a global analysis of present and future losses in the 136 largest coastal cities. They predicted that global flood losses would increase from an average of $6 billion per year in 2005 to $1 trillion by 2050, with projected socioeconomic change, climate change and subsidence. Even if adaptation investments remain constant, flood probability, subsidence and sea level rise will increase global flood losses to $60 billion–$63 billion per year in 2050. The same study found that developing countries are particularly vulnerable to flood risk, with much lower investment in flood protection measures (Hallegatte and others, 2013).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," None of the above"],["B2027","2","Which continent is the world's leader in aquaculture production?","Qual continente é o líder mundial na produção de aquicultura?","Which continent dominate the world aquaculture production?","Qual continente domina a produção de aquicultura?","Asia","Ásia","Asia","Ásia","","\u003cp\u003eThe major growth in aquatic production is expected to come from aquaculture and is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030, an increase of 37 per cent over 2016 levels. However, it is estimated that the annual growth rate of aquaculture will slow from 5.7  per  cent in the period from 2003 to 2016 to 2.1 per cent in the period from 2017 to 2030, mainly because of a reduced rate of growth in Chinese production, offset in part by an increase in production in other countries (FAO, 2018a). The share of farmed aquatic animal species in global fishery production (for food and non-food uses), which was 47  per  cent in 2016, is projected to exceed that of wild species in 2020 and to grow to 54 per cent by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 87 per cent of the increase in aquaculture production in 2030 will come from Asian countries.

A small number of poisonous or venomous marine non-indigenous species represent potential threats to human health. Intensification of anthropogenic activities, coupled with rapidly increasing coastal urbanization, drive complex and fundamental changes in coastal waters, including increases in alien species. Some of the alien venomous and poisonous species have attracted the attention of scientists, managers, the media and the public for their conspicuous human health impacts. In the Mediterranean alone, 10 non-indigenous species are considered human health hazards, running the gamut from nuisance to lethal (Galil, 2018). Human health hazards of non-indigenous species are expected to worsen as a result of climate change. The poleward influx of warm water biota enables them to spread to regions as yet uncolonized;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eA further, recently identified health threat is the potential role of plastic marine litter as a vector for opportunistic human pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Barboza and others, 2018; Harrison and others, 2018; Imran and others, 2019). Various pathogenic bacteria bind, in particular and strongly, to plastic litter (for example, Vibrio cholerae and some strains of Escherichia coli). Such human pathogens can colonize plastic surfaces in stable biofilms. The scientific and medical understanding of that health threat of plastic pollution is inadequate but the threat is dealt with as a further aspect of the problem of marine litter discussed in chapter 12.

Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4).

Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019).

Recovery is still in progress and has been seriously affected by the massive drop in world trade caused by the COVID-19 crisis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch growth, however, has occurred against a weak competitive background for the international shipping industry. The economic crisis that took place from 2008 to 2011 occurred during a time when world shipping had commissioned a large increase in tonnage to meet the increased freight demand of the preceding years. The additional tonnage was delivered at a time when demand had started to reduce, with the result that, during the 2010s, the shipping industry was operating against a background of oversupply, which had the consequence of depressing freight rates. As measures to further control the pollutant emissions from ships take effect (from 2020), further pressures associated with implementing modifications to fleets will be placed on the shipping industry. To meet the new requirements (as detailed in chap.  11), ships must either purchase bunkers with a lower sulfur content (which may have a higher price, since the traditional ships’ bunkers have been the high-sulfur oils for which there was less demand) or retrofit scrubbers to clean the ships’ exhaust.

At the same time, there is a growing tendency to consolidate container shipping, so the combined market share of the top 10 container shipping lines increased from 68 per  cent in 2014 to 90 per cent in 2019. That is combined with a returning interest in container shipping lines integrating their operations with traffic between originators and ports and between ports and the ultimate destinations. Those developments have the ability to undermine competition and thus to result in higher transit costs (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe total world fleet of ships carrying all that cargo amounted to 96,295 ships in early 2019, accounting for 1.97 billion dead-weight tons of capacity. Bulk carriers and oil tankers maintained the largest market shares of vessels that dominated the world fleet, at 42.6 per cent of all vessels and 28.7 per cent of dead-weight tons, respectively. A large proportion of the world’s tonnage continues to be registered in a relatively small number of registries. Nearly 70 per cent of the world’s tonnage is registered in seven registries: Panama (17 per cent), Marshall Islands (12 per cent), Liberia (12 per cent), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (10 per  cent), Singapore (7 per  cent), Malta (6 per cent) and China (5 per cent). No other registry is responsible for more than 4 per  cent of the world’s tonnage (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, ownership and control of shipping continues to be concentrated in the hands of firms in a relatively small number of countries. In 2019, five economies accounted for more than 50 per  cent of the world tonnage: Greece, Japan, China, Singapore and Hong Kong, China. Between 2015 and 2019, Greece, Singapore, China and Hong Kong, China have increased the proportion that they own/control (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of new ships still remains very concentrated in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, which together represent 90 per cent of all cargo ship construction activity. The demolition of ships that have reached the end of their useful life likewise continues to be concentrated in the same countries as reported in the first Assessment. In 2018, 47.2 per cent of the total reported tonnage of propelled seagoing vessels of 100 gross tons and above that were sold for demolition were demolished in Bangladesh, 25.6 per  cent in India, 21.5 per  cent in Pakistan, 2.3 per  cent in Turkey and 2 per  cent in China, leaving 1.4 per cent for the rest of the world.

Health has been defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization-Regional Office for Europe (WHO-Europe), 1984). However, people live in an interdependent existence with the totality of the living world. Hence, human health cannot be separated from the health of our total planetary biodiversity and has now been redefined as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and infirmities (Lancet-Editorial, 2009). The complex interactions between the seas and oceans and human health and well‐ being have been viewed primarily within a risk framework, for example, the adverse impacts of extreme weather, chemical pollution (from domestic and industrial effluents, aquaculture, offshore industries, air pollutants and road dust run-off, and black carbon in the Arctic) and, increasingly, climate change (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2017, 2019; Fleming and others, 2019; Pleijel and others, 2013; Tornero and Hanke, 2016; Valotto and others, 2015; Walker and others, 2019; Winiger and others, 2019). However, new research is expanding our concept of the “health” of the “global ocean”, with a broader recognition of its essential and beneficial contribution to the current and future health and well‐being of humankind (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2019; Ercolano and others, 2019; Lindequist, 2016; see table below).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine environment contributes significantly to human health through the provision and quality of the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink and marine-derived pharmaceuticals, as well as providing health-enhancing economic and recreational opportunities (see chaps. 5 and 8A; Ercolano and others, 2019; Lindequist, 2016). The coastal environment can also have a calming effect (White and others, 2013) and provide important cultural benefits (see chap. 28, sect. 1.4). However, at the same time, the marine environment is under pressure from such human activities as transport, industrial processes, fishing, agricultural and waste management practices, climate change-related impacts associated with rising sea levels and coastal erosion, and biological invasions.

Consequently, many of our perceptions of the interactions between the marine environment and human health are limited and still relatively unchallenged, leaving an opportunity to address critical knowledge gaps to further inform science-based policies for the sustainable use of marine resources and environmental and human health protection (see figure below and Moore and others, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe complex nature of the interactions between the marine environment and human health was reviewed by the European Marine Board (Moore and others, 2013, 2014) and others (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2013, 2017, 2019; Fleming and others, 2014, 2019).

The aquaculture sector is no exception. Success in achieving the long-term goal of economic, social and environmental sustainability of the aquaculture sector, so as to ensure its continued contribution of nutritious food to keep the world healthy, will depend primarily on continued commitments by Governments to provide and support a good governance framework for the sector.

The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4).

Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019).

Biosecurity in aquaculture consists of practices that minimize the risk of introducing an infectious disease and spreading it to the animals at a facility and the risk that diseased animals or infectious agents will leave a facility and spread disease to other sites and to other susceptible species.

Countries must monitor other emerging diseases, such as Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in shrimps and tilapia lake virus (Tilapia tilapinevirus), which could potentially have a severe impact on the sector if not addressed in a timely manner (FAO, 2017a). New molecular diagnostic tools are now being applied to the identification of disease agents and their distribution patterns in hatchery, farmed and wild fishes throughout the world.

Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean.

There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018). The projection for risk and damage associated with coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation indicates that they are likely to increase in the future (Dunn and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEcosystem impacts from coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation can be substantial, in particular if there is a transformation from long-term accretion to erosion. Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density. Existing problems have been identified adjacent to the Ganges, Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, Volta and Mississippi river deltas.

Bottom trawling has caused the destruction of a number of long-lived cold-water coral and sponge communities that are unlikely to recover before at least a century. Many reviews show that, locally, the nature of those impacts and their duration depend on the type of substrate and frequency of trawling. Those effects have been found in all the regional assessments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to fish and pelagic invertebrate communities, much effort has been devoted to teasing apart the influences of exploitation and of environmental conditions as drivers of change in fish populations and communities, but definitive answers are elusive.

It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eNIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,4," How"],["B4002","2","How many marine benthic invertebrate species have been described by 2019?","Quantas espécies de invertebrados bentônicos marinhos foram descritas até 2019?","How many marine benthic invertebrate species were cataloged until 2019?","Quantas espécies de invertebrados bentônicos marinhos foram catalogadas até 2019?","153,434","153.434","Around 153,434 species.","Cerca de  153,434 espécies.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eAs of 2019, 153,434 marine benthic invertebrate species had been described globally.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSince 2012, researchers have described 10,777 new marine benthic invertebrate species; at the same time, biodiversity is changing globally at rates unprecedented in human history, creating the potential for species extinction before they have been described.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eThe deep sea covers 43  per  cent of the Earth’s surface, with an estimated 95 per cent of marine invertebrate species still undescribed.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eMajor pressures on marine invertebrates include temperature increase, ocean acidification, physical impacts on the seabed, the extraction of living and non-living resources, coastal use, invasive species and pollution.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eLarge areas of the globe, including areas beyond national jurisdiction, still lack effective and adequate long-term ecosystem monitoring and protection for marine invertebrates.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eDespite new research regarding many important ecosystem processes, functions, goods and services, huge knowledge gaps remain in understanding the impact of reductions in benthic invertebrate biodiversity on human well-being and ecosystem dynamics.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," How"],["B2443","2","What are the impacts of the population growth and increase of industrial and agricultural production on the ocean environment?","Quais são os impactos que o crescimento da população, da produção industrial e da agricultura podem gerar no meio ambiente marítimo?","Which impacts the population growth and increase of industrial and agricultural production cause on the ocean environment?","Quais impactos o crescimento populacional e o aumento da produção industrial e agrícola causam no ambiente oceânico?","It may result in an increased deposit of harmful materials and excess nutrients into the ocean, increased levels of sewage discharge and plastic materials, resulting in the creation of large quantities of marine debris and negative impacts to marine life, ocean aesthetic, and socioeconomic effects.

It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti, French Polynesia, and Darwin, Australia, and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (Rasmussen and Carpenter, 1982).

In some areas, as recorded in the first Assessment, studies suggest that it is possible to manage coral reef tourism (e.g., by limiting the number of divers in an area, specifying divers’ behaviour and generally increasing divers’ awareness of the problems) compatibly with sustaining the condition and health of the reef. In other areas, however, studies continue to suggest that the interaction of divers with coral is damaging the reefs. A recent study of the coral reefs around the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean part of the Netherlands showed that diving is at levels probably at least twice those considered to be the upper limit beyond which damage is likely to occur (see Hawkins and Roberts, 1997), and that damage, albeit largely unintentional, is occurring but could be controlled by better management measures (Jadot and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the decommissioning of offshore installations, significant numbers of disused installations are being used to create artificial reefs.

In 2016, it was estimated that some 600 offshore installations would be decommissioned between 2017 and 2021.

Results indicate that “muck diving” tourism is worth more than $150 million annually in Indonesia and the Philippines combined.

But there are now about seven billion people on Earth. So we each have just one-fifth of a cubic kilometre of ocean to provide us with all the services that we get from the ocean. That small, one-fifth of a cubic kilometre share produces half of the oxygen each of us breathes, all of the sea fish and other seafood that each of us eats. It is the ultimate source of all the freshwater that each of us will drink in our lifetimes. The ocean is a highway for ships that carry across the globe the exports and imports that we produce and consume. It contains the oil and gas deposits and minerals on and beneath the seafloor that we increasingly need to use. The submarine cables across the ocean floor carry 90 per cent of the electronic traffic on which our communications rely. Our energy supply will increasingly rely on wind, wave and tide power from the ocean. Large numbers of us take our holidays by the sea. That onefifth of a cubic kilometre will also suffer from the share of the sewage, garbage, spilled oil and industrial waste which we produce and which is put into the ocean every day. Demands on the ocean continue to rise: by the year 2050 it is estimated that there will be 10 billion people on Earth. So our share (or our children’s share) of the ocean will have shrunk to one-eighth of a cubic kilometre.

We intentionally exploit many components of this biodiverse richness. Carelessly (for example, through inputs of waste) or unknowingly (for example, through ocean acidification from increased emissions of carbon dioxide), we are altering the circumstances in which these plants and animals live. All this is affecting their ability to thrive and, sometimes, even to survive. These impacts of humanity on the oceans are part of our legacy and our future.

For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2194","2","What is the contribution of Aquaculture to human nutrition?","Qual é a contribuição da Aquicultura para a nutrição humana?","How aquaculture supports human nutrition?","Como a aquicultura apoia a nutrição humana?","Aquaculture helps the rural poor, especially mothers and young children, to maintain a healthy diet.","A aquicultura ajuda os pobres rurais, especialmente mães e crianças pequenas, a manter uma dieta saudável.","Aquaculture improves the nutrition of the rural poor, especially mothers and young children (Thilsted and others, 2016), although there are concerns that the growth of the sector and the intensification of its production methods may result in decreased availability of certain fatty acids and micronutrients (Bogard and others, 2017)","A aquicultura melhora a nutrição dos pobres rurais, especialmente mães e crianças pequenas (Thilsted e outros, 2016), embora haja preocupações de que o crescimento do setor e a intensificação de seus métodos de produção possam resultar na diminuição da disponibilidade de certos ácidos graxos e micronutrientes (Bogard e outros, 2017)","","\u003ch1\u003eProduction and species\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAquaculture is expanding faster than other types of food production, although no longer at the growth rates of the 1980s and 1990s (11.3 and 10.0 per cent, respectively, excluding aquatic plants).

Based on figures from 2011, the economic costs of marine plastic, in relation to marine natural capital, are conservatively conjectured to be between $3,300 and $33,000 per ton per year (Beaumont and others, 2019). While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019). More recently (McIlgorm and others, 2020), a ninefold increase in the direct economic costs of marine litter was found from 2009 to 2015, reaching $10.8 billion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to indirect impacts (i.e., on biodiversity and ecosystems), beach litter is perhaps the most visible direct impact and affects the patrimonial value of coastal areas that can be translated as the financial expenditure of cleaning up (UNEP, 2019).

As relevant toxicity data are absent, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that it was currently not possible to evaluate the human health risk of nanoplastics and microplastics (European Food Safety Authority Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2016).

However, it is estimated that the annual growth rate of aquaculture will slow from 5.7  per  cent in the period from 2003 to 2016 to 2.1 per cent in the period from 2017 to 2030, mainly because of a reduced rate of growth in Chinese production, offset in part by an increase in production in other countries (FAO, 2018a). The share of farmed aquatic animal species in global fishery production (for food and non-food uses), which was 47  per  cent in 2016, is projected to exceed that of wild species in 2020 and to grow to 54 per cent by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 87 per cent of the increase in aquaculture production in 2030 will come from Asian countries.

The challenge is to secure suitable land and water resources for the development of aquaculture at the national level.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGood quality seeds and optimal feeds are essential. Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern. In 2016, about 55.6 million tons of farmed fishes (including Indian carps) and crustaceans depended on external feeds (composed of fresh ingredients, farm-made or commercially manufactured) (FAO, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, aquaculture consumed about 4.2 million tons of fishmeal (18.5  per  cent of total aquafeeds by weight). By 2015, this had been reduced to 3.35 million tons (7 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014). The aquaculture sector should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,4,5," What"],["B2077","2","What is the great benefit that aquaculture has over other means of food production?","Qual o grande benefício que a aquicultura possui em relação a outros meios de produção de alimentos?","What are the nutritional benefits of the fish produced by aquaculture in comparison with other food commodities?","Quais são os benefícios nutricionais dos peixes produzidos pela aquicultura em comparação com outras commodities alimentares?","Fish produced in aquaculture is high in protein and contains essential micronutrients, sometimes essential fatty acids, which cannot be easily replaced by other food products.","O peixe produzido em aquicultura é alto em proteínas e contém micronutrientes essenciais, às vezes ácidos graxos essenciais, que não podem ser facilmente substituídos por outros produtos alimentares.","Fish produced by aquaculture is high in protein and in essential micronutrients that cannot easily be substituted by other food commodities.","Peixes produzidos pela aquicultura são ricos em proteínas e em micronutrientes essenciais que não podem ser facilmente substituídos por outros produtos alimentares.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eGlobal aquaculture production in 2017 (animals and plants) was recorded as 111.9 million tons, with an estimated firstsale value of $249.6 billion.

Nevertheless, it continues to grow at a faster rate than other major food production sectors. Annual growth declined to a moderate 5.8  per  cent during the period from 2000 to 2016, although double-digit growth still occurred in a small number of countries, in particular in Africa, from 2006 to 2010.

This will inevitably increase the pressure on food sectors to increase production and reduce losses and waste. Production increases must be able to ensure sustainability, given a context in which key resources, such as land and water, are likely to be scarcer and the impact of climatic change will intensify. The aquaculture sector is no exception. Success in achieving the long-term goal of economic, social and environmental sustainability of the aquaculture sector, so as to ensure its continued contribution of nutritious food to keep the world healthy, will depend primarily on continued commitments by Governments to provide and support a good governance framework for the sector.

The global mean sea level has been rising since 1993 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with a clear superimposed acceleration of approximately 0.1 mm per year. Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions.

One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future.

The most commonly valued services are tourism and recreation, as well as storm protection (Mehvar and others, 2018). Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries. Fishes and other seafood are a major source of food, protein and micronutrients for many vulnerable communities. It is estimated that, in 2016, 59.6 million people were employed in the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture, with a great majority in low-income countries (although that figure includes some inland activities).

While goods have a direct use (consumptive) value, determined through market prices, services and cultural benefits have an indirect use (non-consumptive) value that can be determined through the application of a variety of valuation techniques (see figure).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch1\u003eProvisioning services of marine and coastal ecosystems\u003c/h1\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean provides a multitude of direct and indirect benefits of value to humans.

In 2016, 79.3 million tons of marine fishes2 were caught, and 28.7 million tons of marine aquaculture species were farmed, supplying together an average of 14.6 kg of seafood per person on earth (FAO, 2018).

Passenger landings and marine traffic are highly concentrated at a few specific locations, in particular along the Antarctic Peninsula’s south-western coast. Growth in Antarctic tourism is closely correlated with the economies of the countries sending the most visitors to the region: 60 per cent of the tourists come from the United States (33 per cent), China (16 per cent) and Australia (11 per cent). The proportion of tourists from China increased significantly between 2013 and 2014 and between 2017 and 2018.

Oysters, for example, can concentrate such pathogens up to 99 times the level in their surrounding water (Burkhardt and Calci, 2000; Morris and Acheson, 2003; Motes and others, 1994; Vezzulli and others, 2016). The most common viral pathogens involved were norovirus (83.7 per cent) and the hepatitis A virus (12.8  per  cent) (Bellou and others, 2013). No global database exists on outbreaks of illness of that kind. However, a survey of outbreaks reported between 1980 and 2012 found records of about 368  shellfish-borne viral outbreaks. The majority were located in East Asia, with more than half in Japan, followed by Europe, the Americas, Oceania and Africa. In addition to sewage-borne pathogens, toxins (e.g., yessotoxins, brevetoxins and ciguatoxins) can be produced by toxic algae (e.g., dinoflagellates), often at relatively low concentrations (e.g., 200 cells/l of Alexandrium spp.) and not necessarily restricted to algal blooms (see chap. 10 for causes of such blooms; and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases). Algal toxins can enter the food web and are often present in shellfish and fish where they can cause illness as a result of their consumption as human food. The health impacts of algal toxins are not limited to illnesses and deaths caused by poisoning, but also include health impacts from the loss of shellfish and other fisheries that have to be closed to protect people from poisoning, and the disruption of ecosystems caused by deaths of fish and top predators that ingest the algae or the toxins that they produce. Many toxic algal bloom events are reported annually, from all parts of the world, and the number is growing. The increased numbers are, in part, attributable to improved observation and recording, but there is reliable evidence demonstrating a real increase in the incidence of such problem blooms as a result of the interaction of many factors, including rising sea temperatures, increased inputs of nutrients to the ocean, the transfer of non-indigenous species by shipping, and changes in the balance of nutrients in the sea (Hinder and others, 2012). Health warning systems could be implemented in higher risk areas by involving not only the public health authorities, but also community planners, utility managers and designers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEffective monitoring and management programmes are, however, in place in some “at-risk” regions to prevent such toxins from being found in commercial seafood (Anderson, 2009; Anderson and others, 2001; see chap. 10). Such programmes are based on rigorous research on method development and validation, as well as the understanding of temporal and spatial patterns of toxic algae and knowledge of their transfer to humans.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eToxic algal blooms are complex phenomena, and many different disciplines need to be involved in finding a way to address the problems they cause, ranging from molecular and cell biology to large-scale field surveys, numerical modelling and remote sensing (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IOC), 2017). Other biogenic toxins of health concern, which are not produced by algal blooms, include cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria, tetrodotoxins produced by symbiotic bacteria, which are used by metazoans as a defensive biotoxin to ward off predation or as both a defensive and predatory venom, and palytoxins, which are intense vasoconstrictors that pose risks to humans primarily through exposure to coral (Bane and others, 2014; Ramos and Vasconcelos, 2010; Zanchett and Oliveira-Filho, 2013). Humans who consume shellfish contaminated with brevetoxins, which are produced by some species of plankton, are at high risk of developing neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. There are also reports of skin ailments resulting from contact with brevetoxin-contaminated water and of respiratory illness from brevetoxin aerosols, in particular in vulnerable people with asthma (Hoagland and others, 2009). Shellfish metabolites of brevetoxin can also show different patterns of toxicity (Turner and others, 2015). Tetrodotoxins, produced by some species of bacteria, and ciguatoxins, produced by some species of plankton, can accumulate in fish and other seafood and are poisonous when consumed. Those types of biogenic toxins were previously associated with tropical waters but are now being found in temperate zones (Rodriguez and others, 2008; Silva and others, 2015a, 2015b). The social costs of all those illnesses can be huge, and the estimated costs related to illnesses from toxic algal blooms in just one single county in Florida, United States, amounted to between $0.5 million and $4.0 million (Hoagland and others, 2009).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2094","2","What can happen if the use of fertilizers is not well managed?","O que pode acontecer se o uso de fertilizantes não for bem administrado?","What are the consequences of fertilizer overuse for oceans?","Quais as consequências do uso excessivo de fertilizantes para os oceanos?","It has the potential to lead to increased nutrient run-off to the ocean","Tem o potencial de levar a um aumento do escoamento de nutrientes para o oceano","The running off of ground nutrients to the oceans can be increased.","O escoamento de nutrientes do solo para o oceano pode aumentar.","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eAgricultural inputs\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe agricultural revolution of the last part of the twentieth century, which has largely enabled the world to feed its rapidly growing population, has also brought with it problems for the ocean in the form of enhanced run-off of both agricultural nutrients and pesticides, as well as the airborne and waterborne inputs of nutrients from waste from agricultural stock. In the case of fertilizers, their use is rapidly growing in parts of the world where only limited use had occurred in the past. That growth has the potential to lead to increased nutrient run-off to the ocean if the increased use of fertilizers is not managed well. There are therefore challenges in educating farmers, promoting good husbandry practices that cause less nutrient run-off and monitoring what is happening to agricultural run-off alongside sewage discharges. In the case of pesticides, the issues are analogous to those of industrial development. Newer pesticides are less polluting than older ones, but there are gaps in the capacity to ensure that these less-polluting pesticides are used, in terms of educating farmers, enabling them to afford the newer pesticides, supervising the distribution systems and monitoring what is happening in the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2299","2","What geographic accidents are generated from the geomorphic activity that occurs in the abyssal plains that exist between the continents?","Que acidentes geográficos são gerados a partir da atividade geomórfica que ocorre nas planícies abissais existentes entre os continentes?","What geographic accidents result from geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents?","Que acidentes geográficos resultam da atividade geomórfica nas planícies abissais entre os continentes?","Abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-shaped seamounts), valley segments and trenches.","Cristas abissais, ilhas vulcânicas, montes submarinos, montes submarinos em forma de planalto, segmentos de vale e trincheiras.","Ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches.","Cumes, ilhas vulcânicas, montes submarinos, guyots (montes submarinos parecidos com planaltos), segmentos de fissuras e trincheiras.","","\u003cp\u003eA new digital, global seafloor geomorphic features map has been built (especially to assist the World Ocean Assessment) using a combination of manual and ArcGIS methods based on the analysis and interpretation of the latest global bathymetry grid (Harris et al., 2014; Figure 1).

The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",false,true,3,5,5," What"],["B2364","2","What are the ways humans change the ocean for the worse?","De quais formas humanos mudam o oceano para pior?","How do humans alter the ocean negatively?","Com os seres humanos alteram o oceano negativamente?","Through inputs of waste or through the ocean acidification from increased emissions of carbon dioxide.","Através do descarte de dejetos ou através da acidificação do oceano pela elevada emissão de dióxido de carbono.","Humans alter the circumstances in which plants and animals live, carelessly (for example, through inputs of waste) or unknowingly (for example, through ocean acidification from increased emissions of carbon dioxide).","Os humanos alteram as circunstâncias em que as plantas e os animais vivem, descuidadamente (por exemplo, por meio de entradas de resíduos) ou sem saber (por exemplo, por meio da acidificação do oceano devido ao aumento das emissões de dióxido de carbono).","","\u003cp\u003eConsider how dependent upon the ocean we are. The ocean is vast – it covers seven-tenths of the planet. On average, it is about 4,000 metres deep. It contains 1.3 billion cubic kilometres of water (97 per cent of all water on Earth). But there are now about seven billion people on Earth. So we each have just one-fifth of a cubic kilometre of ocean to provide us with all the services that we get from the ocean. That small, one-fifth of a cubic kilometre share produces half of the oxygen each of us breathes, all of the sea fish and other seafood that each of us eats. It is the ultimate source of all the freshwater that each of us will drink in our lifetimes. The ocean is a highway for ships that carry across the globe the exports and imports that we produce and consume. It contains the oil and gas deposits and minerals on and beneath the seafloor that we increasingly need to use. The submarine cables across the ocean floor carry 90 per cent of the electronic traffic on which our communications rely. Our energy supply will increasingly rely on wind, wave and tide power from the ocean. Large numbers of us take our holidays by the sea. That onefifth of a cubic kilometre will also suffer from the share of the sewage, garbage, spilled oil and industrial waste which we produce and which is put into the ocean every day. Demands on the ocean continue to rise: by the year 2050 it is estimated that there will be 10 billion people on Earth. So our share (or our children’s share) of the ocean will have shrunk to one-eighth of a cubic kilometre. That reduced share will still have to provide each of us with sufficient amounts of oxygen, food and water, while still receiving the pollution and waste for which we are all responsible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean is also home to a rich diversity of plants and animals of all sizes – from the largest animals on the planet (the blue whales) to plankton that can only be seen with powerful microscopes. We use some of these directly, and many more contribute indirectly to our benefits from the ocean. Even those which have no connection whatever with us humans are part of the biodiversity whose value we have belatedly recognized. However, the relationships are reciprocal. We intentionally exploit many components of this biodiverse richness. Carelessly (for example, through inputs of waste) or unknowingly (for example, through ocean acidification from increased emissions of carbon dioxide), we are altering the circumstances in which these plants and animals live. All this is affecting their ability to thrive and, sometimes, even to survive. These impacts of humanity on the oceans are part of our legacy and our future. They will shape the future of the ocean and its biodiversity as an integral physical-biological system, and the ability of the ocean to provide the services which we use now and will increasingly need to use in the future.

Thus, investment, along with a focus on biosecurity and health, have been on the increase worldwide (Subasinghe and others, 2019). Biosecurity in aquaculture consists of practices that minimize the risk of introducing an infectious disease and spreading it to the animals at a facility and the risk that diseased animals or infectious agents will leave a facility and spread disease to other sites and to other susceptible species. These practices also reduce stress on the animals, thus making them less susceptible to disease.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe long list of aquatic diseases and pathogens includes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, which recently devastated shrimp aquaculture in Asian countries (e.g. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand). The causative agent is a virulent strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a bacterium commonly found in coastal waters. Revenue loss due to the disease in South-East Asia has been estimated at over $4 billion. Countries must monitor other emerging diseases, such as Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in shrimps and tilapia lake virus (Tilapia tilapinevirus), which could potentially have a severe impact on the sector if not addressed in a timely manner (FAO, 2017a). New molecular diagnostic tools are now being applied to the identification of disease agents and their distribution patterns in hatchery, farmed and wild fishes throughout the world.

Small-scale fisheries, particularly those that provide subsistence in many poor communities, are often particularly important. Many such coastal fisheries are under threat because of overexploitation, conflict with larger fishing operations and a loss of productivity in coastal ecosystems caused by a variety of other impacts.

The most commonly valued services are tourism and recreation, as well as storm protection (Mehvar and others, 2018). Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries. Fishes and other seafood are a major source of food, protein and micronutrients for many vulnerable communities. It is estimated that, in 2016, 59.6 million people were employed in the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture, with a great majority in low-income countries (although that figure includes some inland activities).

In addition to laws, regulations and voluntary codes aimed at ensuring environmental integrity, some of the means of achieving this goal include innovative, less polluting techniques proposed by the ecosystem approach to aquaculture, which emphasizes management for sustainability (FAO, 2010) and provides a planning and management framework to effectively integrate aquaculture into local planning (Brugère and others, 2018). Although efforts related to intensification have resulted in decreased use of land and fresh water per unit of fish produced (FAO, 2017a), they have also led to an increase in the use of energy and feed, and in pollution, per unit of farmed fish (Hall and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough aquaculture has been accused of having negative environmental and social impacts (Bushmann and Fortt, 2005; Isla Molleda and others, 2016) and suffers from a biased perception on the part of the public, it has, from an ecological efficiency and environmental impact point of view, clear benefits over other forms of animal food production for human consumption. Life-cycle assessment is useful to determine environmental impacts and ensure environmentally sustainable development (Bohnes and Laurent, 2019).  Farmed finfish is similar in feed conversion efficiency to poultry and much more efficient than beef. Recent estimates indicate that demand for feed crops and land for aquaculture will be less than for alternative food production systems, even if over one third of protein production comes from aquaculture, by 2050 (Froehlich and others, 2018). Filter-feeding carps and molluscs are even more efficient producers of animal protein, as they require no human-managed feeds and can improve water quality. Because aquaculture is relatively new, it offers great scope for innovation to increase resource efficiency (Waite and others, 2014). Where resources are stretched, the relative benefits of policies that promote aquaculture over other forms of livestock production should be considered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, the environmental performance of aquaculture has improved significantly over the past decade. If aquaculture production doubles by 2030, the sector must improve its productivity and environmental performance for growth to be sustainable (Waite and others, 2014). In order to achieve “sustainable intensification”, aquaculture must: (a) advance socioeconomic development; (b) provide safe, affordable and nutritious food; (c) increase production of fish relative to the amount of land, water, feed and energy used; and (d) minimize environmental impacts, fish diseases and escapes (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2511","2","Who are the people who benefit most from fish-based food?","Quem são as pessoas que mais se beneficiam da alimentação baseada em peixes?","Which part of the population is most nutritionally benefited from aquaculture?","Qual parte da população é mais beneficiada nutricionalmente por conta da aquacultura?","rural poor people","Pessoas pobres rurais"," The rural poor","Os pobres rurais","","\u003ch1\u003eProduction and species\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAquaculture is expanding faster than other types of food production, although no longer at the growth rates of the 1980s and 1990s (11.3 and 10.0 per cent, respectively, excluding aquatic plants).

Global production in 2016 included 80 million tons of food fishes, 30.1 million tons of aquatic plants and 37,900 tons of non-food products.

China, the major aquaculture producer in 2016, has produced more than the rest of the world combined since 1991. The other major producers in 2016 were India, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Egypt and Norway. Aquatic plants (28 million tons) included seaweeds and a much smaller volume of microalgae.

It is classified by the nature of the material, such as plastic, metal, glass, rubber or wood, or by sources or uses, such as fishing gear, industrial pellets, sanitary items and single-use plastics. Plastic, defined as polymers synthesized from hydrocarbon molecules or biomass with thermoplastic or thermoset properties, comprises the main component of marine litter and exhibits a wide range of properties, shapes and compositions (GESAMP, 2016). In 2018, approximately 348 million tons of plastic waste had been generated worldwide (PlasticsEurope, 2019), with annual amounts entering the ocean in the range of 4.8 to 12.7 million tons, based on data from 2010 (Jambeck and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMarine litter is most obvious on shorelines, where it accumulates from water currents, wave and wind action and river outflows.

It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eNIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,4," What"],["B2089","2","What is the percentage wise coverage of sea ice relative to the total oceanic area?","Em termos percentuais, qual a cobertura de gelo marinho relativo à área oceânica total?","How much percent of the total oceanic area is covered with sea ice?","Quantos por cento do oceano estão cobertos com gelo marinho?","15%","15%","15%","15%","","\u003cp\u003eGlobal surface ocean pH has declined on average by approximately 0.1 since the Industrial Revolution, an increase in acidity of about 30 per cent. Ocean pH is projected to decline by approximately an additional 0.3 over the next century unless global carbon emissions are significantly curtailed. The changes can be observed in extended ocean time series, and the rate of change is likely to be unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years. The time of emergence of the signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites and 16 to 41 years for coastal sites, making it necessary to commit to long-term observational records, especially in the coastal zone, where most commercially and culturally important marine resources reside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOceanic oxygen levels have declined in recent decades, with strong regional variations. While the overall oxygen content has decreased by about 2 per cent in five decades, oxygen in coastal areas or near oxygen minimum zones shows larger variations. Coastal changes are mostly fuelled by riverine run-off, and the open ocean changes are likely related to a combination of changes in ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Temperature-driven solubility decrease is responsible for most near-surface oxygen loss, while other processes have to be accountable for deep-ocean oxygen loss. A further decrease in oxygen in and near oxygen minimum zones can lead to climate feedback through consequent greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice covers 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation. Total sea ice extent has been declining rapidly in the Arctic, but trends are insignificant in the Antarctic. Arctic sea ice extent is declining by -2.7 ± 0.4 per cent c-1 during the winter, and -2.8 ± 2.3 per cent c-1 during the summer. In contrast, trends in total Antarctic sea ice extent are insignificant, 0.6 ± 0.6 per cent c-1 during the summer and 1.1 ± 3.7 per cent c-1 during the winter. Regionally, the spatial distribution of the trends is dramatic. In the Arctic, the summer trends are most striking in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, while, in the Antarctic, the summer trends show increases in the Weddell Sea and decreases in the West Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. The spatial distribution of the changes in sea ice is attributed to changes in wind and ocean currents related to the Arctic Oscillation in the northern hemisphere and the Southern Annular Mode and El Niño in the southern hemisphere.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2231","2","What was the net growth of the Arctic ice sheet before 1990?","Qual era o crescimento líquido do manto de gelo do Ártico antes de 1990?","How much was the ice discharge of the Arctic ice sheet before 1990","Quanto era o desgelo do manto de gelo do Ártico antes de 1990","50 Gt/y.","50 Gt/a.","It was 300 Gt/y","Era de 300 Gt/A","","\u003cp\u003eThe polar ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are the largest reservoirs of freshwater on the planet, holding 7 m and 58 m of the sea-level equivalent, respectively (Vaughan et al., 2013). The net growth or shrinkage of such an ice sheet is a balance between the net accumulation of snow at the surface, the loss from meltwater runoff, and the calving of icebergs and submarine melting at tidewater margins, collectively known as marine ice loss. There is some debate about the relative importance of these in the case of Greenland. Van den Broeke et al. (2009), show the volume transport to the ocean is almost evenly split between runoff of surface meltwater and marine ice loss. In a more recent work, Box and Colgan (2013) estimate marine ice loss at about twice the volume of meltwater (see Figure 5 in that article), with both marine ice loss and particularly runoff increasing rapidly since the late 1990s. According to the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP, 2011), the annual mass of freshwater being added at the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (the surface mass balance) has decreased since 1990. Model reconstructions suggest a 40% decrease from 350 Gt/y (1970 - 2000) to 200 Gt/y in 2007. Accelerating ice discharge from outlet glaciers since 1995 - 2002 is widespread and has gradually moved further northward along the west coast of Greenland with global warming. According to AMAP (2011), the ice discharge has increased from the pre-1990 value of 300 Gt/y to 400 Gt/y in 2005.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAntarctica’s climate is much colder, hence surface meltwater contributions are negligible and mass loss is dominated by submarine melting and ice flow across the grounding line where this ice meets the ocean floor (Rignot and Thomas, 2002). Freshwater fluxes from ice sheets differ from continental river runoff in two important respects. First, large fractions of both Antarctic ice sheets are grounded well below sea level in deep fjords or continental shelf embayments; therefore freshwater is injected not at the surface of the ocean but at several hundred meters water depth. This deep injection of freshwater enhances ocean stratification which, in turn, plays a role in ecosystem structure. Second, unlike rivers, which act as a point source for freshwater entering the ocean, icebergs calved at the grounding line constitute a distributed source of freshwater as they drift and melt in adjacent ocean basins (Bigg et al., 1997; Enderlin and Hamilton, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice is one of the smallest reservoirs of freshwater by volume, but it exhibits enormous seasonal variability in spatial extent as it waxes and wanes over the polar oceans. By acting as a rigid cap, sea ice modulates the fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean. Summertime melting of Arctic sea ice is an important source of freshwater flux into the North Atlantic, and episodes of enhanced sea ice export to warmer latitudes farther south give rise to rapid freshening episodes, such as the Great Salinity Anomaly of the late 1960s (Gelderloos et al., 2012). The spatial distributions of these freshwater fluxes drive important patterns in regional and global ocean circulation, which are discussed in Chapter 5.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,1," What"],["B2440","2","What needs to be more studied regarding aquaculture?","O que precisa ser mais estudado em relação à aquicultura?","what aspects of improvement need to be further investigated in relation to aquaculture?","quais aspectos de melhoria precisam ser mais investigados em relação à aquicultura","The knowledge regarding the impact of climate change on aquaculture still needs to be improved, in which more research is necessary to improve seeds, feeds, and the health management of the industry.

Although the lion’s share of production originates in Asia, opposition to aquaculture development is strongest in some developed countries (Froehlich and others, 2017), where aquaculture is still a relatively new industry competing with well-established activities. The world’s knowledge regarding the impact of climate change on aquaculture needs to be improved. Further research and investigation is necessary to improve seeds, feeds and health management. The increasing dependence of developed countries on farmed seafood imports from developing countries and insecurity regarding product environmental, social and safety credentials have sparked considerable public debate. Scientific uncertainties and conflicting information on the issues relating to seafood consumption have further confused the public. The establishment and application of third-party certification systems, covering the environmental, social and food safety concerns related to seafood, have begun to ease this situation. More research is needed to communicate the nutritional and health benefits of increased consumption of seafood. Determination of the nutritional profiles of cultured fishes and wild-caught products and quantification of the health benefits of socioeconomic improvements through aquaculture need further attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growing world population, annual supply from the aquaculture sector must surpass supply from capture fisheries and reach 62 per cent in 2030 in order to maintain current consumption levels. This presents tremendous challenges to the sector, to policymakers and to the aquaculture community at large. Improving perceptions will be instrumental in achieving this goal (Vannuccini and others, 2018). Better information and exchange thereof would help in allaying concerns, dispelling myths and resolving ambiguities. To improve public awareness of aquaculture, the industry needs a more open, broader dialogue that will increase transparency. To communicate the benefits of aquaculture more effectively, it must collaborate more with stakeholder groups viewed as credible by the public. While significant social and environmental issues are still to be addressed, it is important to put aquaculture in a wider perspective by comparing its costs and benefits with those of other animal production systems and with its potential contribution to sustainable food security, given forecasted demographic pressures. However, a holistic view, with a balanced evaluation of the risks and benefits of aquaculture, has been lacking, thus impeding the development of policies that reflect production realities (Bacher, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,4,5," What"],["B2164","2","How many seafarers serving on international merchant ships were estimated to be in 2015, considering both officers and ratings?","Quantos marinheiros servindo em navios mercantes internacionais foram estimados em 2015, considerando tanto os oficiais quanto os aprendizes?","How many seafarers officers and ratings were estimated in 2015 on the international merchant ships?","Quantos marinheiros oficiais e aprendizes eram estimados em 2015 a bordo de navios mercantes internacionais?","1647500","1647500","1,647,500, of which 774,000 were officers and 873,500 ratings.","1647500, dos quais 774000 eram oficiais e 873500 aprendizes","","\u003ch1\u003eSeafarers\u003c/h1\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of seafarers serving on international merchant ships was estimated in 2015 at 1,647,500, of which 774,000 were officers and 873,500 ratings.

That system is influenced by the seasonal changes caused by the Earth’s tilted rotation with respect to the sun. Variations in sea-surface temperature among different parts of the ocean are important in creating winds, areas of high and low air pressure and storms (including the highly damaging hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones). In their turn, winds help to shape the surface currents of the ocean, which transport heat from the tropics towards the poles. The ocean surface water arriving in the cold polar regions partly freezes, rendering the remainder more saline and thus heavier. That more saline water sinks to the bottom and flows towards the equator, starting a return flow to the tropics: the meridional overturning circulation, also called the thermohaline circulation. A further overall forcing factor is the movements generated by the tidal system, predominantly driven by the gravitational effect of the moon and sun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe movements of seawater help to control the distribution of nutrients in the ocean. The ocean enjoys both a steady (and, in some places, excessive) input from land of inorganic nutrients needed for plant growth (especially nitrogen, phosphorus and their compounds, but also lesser amounts of other vital nutrients) and a continuous recycling of all the nutrients already in the ocean through biogeochemical processes, including bacterial action. Areas of upwelling, where nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, are particularly important, because they result in a high level of primary production from photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the zone of light penetration, combining carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the other nutrients, and releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Whether in the water column or when it sinks to the seabed, that primary production constitutes the basis on which the oceanic food web is built, through each successive layer up to the top predators (large fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles, seabirds and, through capture fisheries, humans).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe distribution of living marine resources around the world is the outcome of that complex interplay of geological forms, ocean currents, nutrient fluxes, weather, seasons and sunlight. Not surprisingly, the resulting distribution of living resources reflects that complexity. Because some ocean areas have high levels of primary production, the density of living marine resources in those areas and the contiguous areas to which currents carry that production is also high. Some of those areas of dense living marine resources are also areas of high biological diversity. The general level of biological diversity in the ocean is also high.

This is, of course, most significant in coastal seas. The tidal range varies according to local geography: the largest mean tidal ranges (around 11.7 metres) are found in the Bay of Fundy, on the Atlantic coast of Canada, but ranges only slightly less are also found in the Bristol Channel in the United Kingdom, on the northern coast of France, and on the coasts of Alaska, Argentina and Chile (NOAA 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal warming is likely to affect many aspects of ocean processes. Changes in seasurface temperature, sea level and other primary impacts will lead, among other things, to increases in the frequency of major tropical storms (cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons) bigger ocean swell waves and reduced polar ice formation. Each of these consequences has its own consequences, and so on (Harley et al., 2006; Occhipinti-Ambrogi, 2007).

That harvest is estimated to have a first (gross) value on the order of 113 billion dollars. Although it is difficult to produce accurate employment statistics, estimates using a fairly narrow definition of employment have put the figure of those employed in fisheries and aquaculture at 58.3 million people (4.4 per cent of the estimated total of economically active people), of which 84 per cent are in Asia and 10 per cent in Africa. Women are estimated to account for more than 15 per cent of people employed in the fishery sector. Other estimates, probably taking into account a wider definition of employment, suggest that capture fisheries provide direct and indirect employment for at least 120 million persons worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall-scale fisheries employ more than 90 per cent of the world’s capture fishermen and fish workers, about half of whom are women. When all dependants of those taking full- or part-time employment in the full value chain and support industries (boatbuilding, gear construction, etc.) of fisheries and aquaculture are included, one estimate concludes that between 660 and 820 million persons have some economic or livelihood dependence on fish capture and culture and the subsequent direct value chain. No sound information appears to be available on the levels of death and injury of those engaged in capture fishing or aquaculture, but capture fishing is commonly characterized as a dangerous occupation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, a striking shift has occurred in the operation and location of capture fisheries. In the 1950s, capture fisheries were largely undertaken by developed fishing States. Since then, developing countries have increased their share. As a broad illustration, in the 1950s, the southern hemisphere accounted for no more than 8 per cent of landed values. By the last decade, the southern hemisphere’s share had risen to 20 per cent. In 2012, international trade represented 37 per cent of the total fish production in value, with a total export value of 129 billion dollars, of which 70 billion dollars (58 per cent) was exports by developing countries.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAquaculture is responsible for the bulk of the production of seaweeds.

First, there are the economic activities in providing goods and services which are often marketed (fisheries, shipping, communications, tourism and recreation, and so on). Secondly, there are the other tangible ecosystem services which are not part of a market, but which are vital to human life. For example, marine plants (mainly tiny floating diatoms) produce about 50 per cent of atmospheric oxygen. Mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses are also natural carbon sinks. Coastal habitats, including coral reefs, protect homes, communities and businesses from storm surges and wave attack. Thirdly, there are the intangible ecosystem services. We know that the ocean means far more to us than just merely the functional or practical services that it provides. Humans value the ocean in many other ways: for aesthetic, cultural or religious reasons, and for just being there in all its diversity – giving us a “sense of place” (Halpern et al., 2012). Not surprisingly, given the resources that the ocean provides, human settlements have grown up very much near the shore: 38 per cent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the shore, 44 per cent within 150 km, 50 per cent within 200 km, and 67 per cent within 400 km (Small et al 2004).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll these marine ecosystem services have substantial economic value. While there is much debate about valuation methods (and whether some ecosystem services can be valued) and about exact figures, attempts to estimate the value of marine ecosystem services have found such values to be on the order of trillions of US dollars annually (Costanza, et al., 1997). Nearly three-quarters of this value resides in coastal zones (Martínez, et al., 2007). The point is not so much the monetary figure that can be estimated for non-marketed ecosystem services, but rather the fact that people do not need to pay anything for them – these services are nature’s gift to humanity. But we take these services for granted at our peril, because the cost of replacing them, if it were possible to do so, would be immense and in many cases, incalculable.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,3," Why"],["B2454","2","Which is the direct benefit of aquaculture production?","Qual o benefício direto da produção de aquiculturas?","What benefits can we see from aquaculture production?","Quais benefícios podemos observar com a produção de aquiculturas?","Increasing the nutritional health of global population, in specific on rural poor regions","Aumento na saúde alimentar global, em particular em regiões rurais de baixa renda.

Global production in 2016 included 80 million tons of food fishes, 30.1 million tons of aquatic plants and 37,900 tons of non-food products. Food production included 54.1 million tons of finfishes, 17.1 million tons of molluscs, 7.9 million tons of crustaceans and 938,500 tons of other animals. China, the major aquaculture producer in 2016, has produced more than the rest of the world combined since 1991. The other major producers in 2016 were India, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Egypt and Norway. Aquatic plants (28 million tons) included seaweeds and a much smaller volume of microalgae.

The services are essential to the maintenance and creation of social capital, education, cultural identity and traditions (human and social capital). Around the world, many beliefs and rituals are rich in references to the sea. Research on marine and coastal cultural ecosystem services is, however, still limited (Garcia Rodrigues and others, 2017; Blythe and others, 2020; Diaz and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSome cultural practices form integral parts of the traditional use of the ocean (such as ways of building boats or harvesting shellfish, and stone fish traps found across the coast of South-East Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands). The diversity and technological sophistication of such structures attest to indigenous traditional knowledge of the ocean and its resources (Jeffery, 2013; Rowland and Ulm, 2011) Traditional watercraft such as the Hawaiian voyaging canoe Hōkūle`a provide an active platform for the restoration and maintenance of Pacific non-instrument navigation and cultural identity. Numerous other voyaging canoes have been constructed in the Pacific and, in many places, knowledge of traditional wayfinding has been preserved. Fautasi races in Samoa and dragon boat races in China merge history and cultural traditions with health, fitness and competition. People have long incorporated water-related activities as habitual or significant parts of their lives. Other non-consumptive ocean activities are swimming, diving, kayaking, surfing, sailing and wildlife viewing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, for many indigenous communities, fishing and the sharing of fishes form essential parts of traditional foodways, which support sociocultural cohesion and identity as well as linked ceremonial and cultural practices (Loring and others, 2019; Leong and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOther cultural activities represent ways of reacting to the ocean (such as dances to celebrate the ocean or religious practices to safeguard against danger on the ocean). Such practices can constitute an important part of the cultural heritage of a people. One example is the role of whale hunting for the indigenous peoples of the western seaboard of Canada and the United States of America, as discussed in the first World Ocean Assessment. In Washington State, United States, one tribe, the Makah, has been pursuing special authorization to resume some whale hunting since 2005. In November 2019, a hearing was held for the tribe’s request and, in February 2020, a revised environmental impact assessment was published. The Makah fear that, without the special authorization, that particular element of their culture would remain connected to the past without any present reinforcement (A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2015; 2020).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,4," What"],["B2350","2","In which place was a microalgae extinct?","Em que lugar uma microalga foi extinta?","Where did the microalgae that was listed as extinct was from?","De qual local era proveniente a microalga que foi listada como extinta?","In Australia","Na Austrália","In Australia ","Na Austrália.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSome 90  per  cent of mangrove, seagrass and marsh plant species have been assessed as being at risk of extinction; 19  per  cent of mangroves, 21  per  cent of seagrass species and one marsh plant species are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eAmong macroalgae, 1 species of red seaweed from Australia (Vanvoorstia bennettiana) is listed as Extinct, 10 species (six red algae and four brown algae) are listed as Critically Endangered, 1 species of brown alga is listed as Endangered, and 4 species (three red algae and one brown alga) are listed as Vulnerable.

A principal form of mercury to which humans are exposed is organic methyl mercury (MeHg). The principal source of inorganic mercury in the sea is the burning of fossil fuels (see chap. 11). Such mercury is converted into MeHg by microbes in the aquatic environment, where it bioaccumulates in food webs. In humans, MeHg exposure occurs predominantly through the consumption of seafood. MeHg is a neurotoxin and is particularly harmful to fetal brain development. A large body of research has demonstrated a link between exposure to MeHg in the womb and developmental neurotoxicity (e.g., deficits in fine motor skills, language and memory) among populations that consume seafood regularly. A review of studies in 43 countries showed that pooled average biomarkers suggested an intake of MeHg that was:\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003col\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSeveral times above the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-WHO reference level for consumption in fish-consuming inhabitants of coasts and riverbanks living near small-scale gold-mining installations;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eWell over the reference level in consumers of marine mammals in Arctic regions;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eApproaching the reference level in coastal regions in South-East Asia, the western Pacific and the Mediterranean.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ol\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the two former groups have a higher risk of neurotoxicity than the latter, the coastal regions of South-East Asia are home to very large populations.

Other experts, while recognizing the threat from MeHg, argue that it is important also to balance the benefits from fish-derived lipids with possible risks when considering fish as part of the diet of mothers and their children (Myers and others, 2015). Certain fish species have been identified as being at greater risk for MeHg exposure than others (e.g., MeHg biomagnifies in the aquatic food chain and larger predatory fish, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and certain species of tuna), so making appropriate choices in fish consumption can lead to increasing the benefits of eating seafood while decreasing the potential risk (Silbernagel and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,4," How"],["B2481","2","Why not use energy from waves and ocean currents?","Porque  não utilizar a energia proveniente de ondas e das correntes oceânicas?","Why are wave and ocean current energy production projects not yet largely deployed?","Por que projetos de produção de energia de ondas e correntes oceânicas ainda não são largamente implantados?","Because so far, projects that generate energy from tides are still rare, and those that exist have not yet reached full commercialization.","Porque até o momento, os projetos que geram energia a partir de marés ainda são raros, e os que existem  ainda não alcançaram a comercialização plena .","Projects have not yet achieved commercialization at utility scale.","Os projetos ainda não alcançaram comercialização em grande escala.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eThe offshore wind sector is expanding globally to regions with no utility-scale (grid) installations at present.

The rapid increase in the demand for water, food, land and power has led to human interventions, such as the construction of large dams, deforestation, intensive agriculture expansion, urbanization, infrastructural construction and sand mining. Such human activities have placed those systems under immense stress, leading to large-scale and irreversible changes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (2018), globally, there are 59,071 dams with heights of more than 15 m and related reservoirs of more than 3 million m3. The largest densities of hydropower dams are found in South America, South Asia and Northern Europe. The largest dams, including those have been built, are under construction or are planned, are located in the Mekong River basin, the Amazon River basin and the Congo River basin (Kondolf and others, 2014; Warner and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of dams and reservoirs can reduce the sediment supply to the coast by different degrees (Slagel and Griggs, 2008), sometimes by more than 50 per cent (Besset and others, 2019), leading to the erosion of deltas and adjacent coasts. The reduction in sediment supply to the coasts is expected to increase greatly in the twenty-first century (Dunn and others, 2018), by 50 to 100 per cent (Kondolf and others, 2014; Besset and others, 2019). For example, in the Pearl River, China, the construction of two mega dams (Yangtan and Longtan) has reduced the fluvial sediment supply to the coast by 70  per  cent over the period 1992–2013 (Ranasinghe and others, 2019). Kondolf and others (2014) found that 140 dams had been built, were under construction or were planned for the Mekong River or its tributaries. Under a “definite future”, if 38 dams that are planned or are under construction are actually completed, the cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta would be 51 per cent; and if all dams that are planned and under construction are completed, there would be a cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta of 96 per cent. That would lead to a serious decay of mangrove systems and, as a consequence, the erosion of the coast and irreversible changes in the surrounding ecosystem.

Presently, coastal beach and seabed sand mining is common practice in many countries, although it is sometimes illegal.

Fishes provide more than 4.5 billion people with at least 15 per cent of their animal protein intake. The nutritional properties of fishes make them important to the health of consumers in developed and developing countries. Fishes are efficient converters of feed into high quality food and their carbon footprint is lower than that of other animal production systems. Fisheries and aquaculture value chains contribute substantially to the income and employment, and therefore indirectly to the food security, of more than 10 per cent of the world’s population, principally in developing countries and emerging economies (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 80 million tons of aquatic animals produced in 2016 contributed 46 per cent to total aquatic animal production and a little over 54  per  cent to total fish consumption in the same year.

Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOverexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2284","2","What are the differences between the warming process of northern and southern hemisphere?","Qual a diferença entre o processo de aquecimento dos hemisférios sul e norte?","Which characteristics are prominent in the warming process of northern and southern ocean?","Quais as características são predominantes no processo de aquecimento dos oceânos nos hemisférios norte e sul?","Although the northern hemisphere warming is more prominent, the greater volume of the ocean in the southern hemisphere increases the contribution of its warming on the global heat content","Embora o aquecimento no hemisfério norte seja mais proeminente, o volume de água maior nos oceanos do hemisfério sul aumenta a contribuição do seu aquecimento para a quantidade de calor global.","The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic.

Upper-ocean temperature (and hence its heat content) varies over multiple time scales, including seasonal, inter-annual (for example, those associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation), decadal and centennial periods. Depth-averaged ocean-temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive (that is, they show warming) over most of the globe. The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic. Zonally averaged upper-ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths.

The earth is absorbing more heat than it is emitting back into space, and nearly all that excess heat is entering the ocean and being stored there. The ocean has absorbed about 93 per cent of the combined extra heat stored by warmed air, sea, land, and melted ice between 1971 and 2010. During the past three decades, approximately 70 per cent of the world’s coastline has experienced significant increases in sea-surface temperature. This has been accompanied by an increase in the yearly number of extremely hot days along 38 per cent of the world’s coastline. Warming has also been occurring at a significantly earlier date in the year along approximately 36 per cent of the world’s temperate coastal areas (between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres).

In the case of fertilizers, their use is rapidly growing in parts of the world where only limited use had occurred in the past. That growth has the potential to lead to increased nutrient run-off to the ocean if the increased use of fertilizers is not managed well. There are therefore challenges in educating farmers, promoting good husbandry practices that cause less nutrient run-off and monitoring what is happening to agricultural run-off alongside sewage discharges. In the case of pesticides, the issues are analogous to those of industrial development. Newer pesticides are less polluting than older ones, but there are gaps in the capacity to ensure that these less-polluting pesticides are used, in terms of educating farmers, enabling them to afford the newer pesticides, supervising the distribution systems and monitoring what is happening in the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," How"],["B2198","2","How does global warming affect the rain?","Como o aquecimento global afeta a chuva?","What changes they have identified in precipitation behavior because of global warming?","Quais mudanças identificadas no comportamento das chuvas devido ao aquecimento global?","It changes the amount of rain, it causes more extreme precipitation events and causes changes in the balance between snow and rain","Altera a quantidade de chuva observada, causa mais eventos de precipitação extrema e provoca mudanças no equilíbrio entre neve e chuva","1.

Changes that have been identified include shifts in the seasonal distribution and amount of precipitation, an increase in extreme precipitation events, changes in the balance between snow and rain, accelerated melting of glacial ice, and of course sea-level rise. Although a global phenomenon, it is the impact of sea-level rise along the world’s coastlines that has major societal implications. The impacts of these changes are discussed in the next Section.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in the rates of freshwater exchange between the ocean, atmosphere and continents have additional significant impacts. For example, spatial variations in the distribution of evaporation and precipitation create gradients in salinity and heat that in turn drive ocean circulation; ocean freshening also affects ecosystem structure. These aspects and their impacts are discussed in Sections 3 and 4.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother factor potentially contributing to regional changes in the hydrological cycle are changes in ocean surface currents. For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,5,3," How"],["B2422","2","How much coastline is suitable for fish production?","Quanta da costa é adequada para a produção de peixes?","\non the coast, what is the adequate extent to produce fish?","na costa, qual é a extensão adequada para produzir peixes?","Over 11 million square kilometers","Mais de 11 milhões de quilômetros quadrados","11,400,000 km2 of coastline are suitable for fishes","11.400.000 km2 da costa são adequados para peixes","","\u003ch1\u003eInputs and resources\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eLand and water are the most important resources for aquaculture development.

The challenge is to secure suitable land and water resources for the development of aquaculture at the national level.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGood quality seeds and optimal feeds are essential. Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern. In 2016, about 55.6 million tons of farmed fishes (including Indian carps) and crustaceans depended on external feeds (composed of fresh ingredients, farm-made or commercially manufactured) (FAO, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, aquaculture consumed about 4.2 million tons of fishmeal (18.5  per  cent of total aquafeeds by weight). By 2015, this had been reduced to 3.35 million tons (7 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014). The aquaculture sector should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," How"],["B2209","2","Why does the increase in the potential of negotiation between private corporations and governments hamper the protection of marine environments?","Por que o aumento do poder de negociação das corporações privadas com governos dificulta a proteção de ambientes marinhos?","Why corporations and government increase negotiation capabilities can prejudice policies and agreements focused on sustainability?","Por que as crescentes capacidades de negociação entre governos e corporações podem prejudicar políticas e acordos focados em sustentabilidade?","Because it can generate conflicts over the access to resources and property rights, which undermines policies and agreements focused on sustainability","Porque as corporações podem gerar conflitos pelo acesso à recursos e direitos de propriedade, o que prejudica políticas e acordos com foco na sustentabilidade","Because there is conflict of interests between corporations and sustainability policies about resources and properties.

Targets set in association with international agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, have led to an increase in the establishment of marine protected areas and an associated increase in the protection of the marine environment. Regional fisheries management organizations provide for the coordination of efforts aimed at managing shared fishery resources (Haas and others, 2020), and in some regions they have provided for the implementation of effective stock rebuilding frameworks following overfishing (Hillary and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSupporting policies implemented nationally have also improved the management of marine activities in some areas (Evans and others, 2017). However, global inequities, including those associated with wealth, gender, geography, rights and access to resources, can have implications on the effectiveness of policies designed to manage the marine environment (Balvanera and others, 2019). Furthermore, the consolidation and concentration of company ownership has resulted in a few corporations or financiers often controlling large shares of the flows in any market (e.g., Bailey and others, 2018). Corporations have increased potential to negotiate directly with Governments, which could hamper progress towards sustainable outcomes for the marine environment. Where there is conflict over access to resources and property rights, policies and agreements focused on sustainability can be undermined by such conflicts (Suárez-de Vivero and Rodríguez Mateos, 2017).

Where such development is not subject to effective planning and management, impacts on marine flora and fauna can be disastrous. For example, at Vlora Bay in Albania, unplanned development over 15 years has resulted in the disappearance of 50 per cent of the seagrass meadows and a substantial reduction in macroalgae (Fraschetti and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn tourist regions, beach feeding or beach nourishment, which is the replacement of sand on beaches which have had sand removed by coastal currents or extreme weather events, can have considerable economic benefits (Klein and Osleeb, 2010). For example, in the Republic of Korea, an evaluation of the economic benefits of the restoration of the Songdo beach at Busan after typhoon damage in 2003 put the benefits at about $230 million (Chang and Yoon, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe management of beaches is a significant element in managing the impacts of coastal tourism on the marine environment. Beach cleaning and the building of sea walls are generally done to give “sun, sea and sand” tourists surroundings that they find more attractive, and they have significant effects on the local flora and fauna, as recorded in the first Assessment. Studies continue to show that beaches used extensively for tourism support ecosystems that are less rich than those of comparable beaches in the same vicinity that are in protected areas, for example, along the New Jersey coast in the United States, (Kelly, 2014) and near Cadiz, Spain (Reyes-Martínez and others, 2015), and that seawalls supported 23 per cent less biodiversity and 45 per cent fewer organisms than natural shorelines (Gittman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOther interventions to attract tourists to beaches have included the creation of artificial surfing reefs.

Seagrass meadows are more affected by anthropogenic activities, such as siltation, pollution and reclamation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFishing on seamounts has targeted fish aggregations to depths of 1,500 m. Aggregations on spatially limited topographic features are highly vulnerable, and many target species are slow-growing and long-lived, therefore exhibiting little resilience to disturbance. Furthermore, most fisheries use bottom trawls, gear that is highly destructive to benthic communities. Little recolonization is observed years after closure to fishing.

Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",true,true,2,5,5," When"],["B2529","2","What caused so many of the major cargo-carrying operators to have losses in 2012?","O que fez com que tantos dos principais operadores de transporte de carga tivessem perdas em 2012?","What led to the losses in 2012 of major cargo-carrying operators?","O que causou as perdas em 2012 dos principais operadores de transporte de carga?","The overcapacity resulting from the general economic recession.","O excesso de capacidade resultante da recessão econômica geral.","Overcapacity due to the economic recession","Sobrecapacidade devido à recessão econômica","","\u003ch1\u003eDistribution of ocean benefits and disbenefits\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eDevelopments in maritime transport\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll sectors of maritime transport (cargo trades, passenger and vehicle ferries and cruise ships) are growing in line with the world economy.

Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity.

The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,5,5," What"],["B2447","2","How many known species compose the global picture of the diversity of marine fishes?","Quantas espécies conhecidas compõem o quadro global da diversidade de peixes marinhos?","What is the quantity of species that are known in globally?","Qual a quantidade de espécies que é conhecidade globalmente?","The global picture contains 17,762 known species of marine fishes.","O quadro global contém 17.762 espécies conhecidas de peixes marinhos.","17762","17762","","\u003cul\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eThe mobilization of existing data and the development of tools and open, global repositories provide a global picture of the diversity of marine fishes, with 17,762 known species, including 238 species described since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017e).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eWhile knowledge of the biodiversity of marine fishes exceeds that of many other marine taxa, further improvements will be necessary not only in taxonomic and biosystematic infrastructure but also in the exploration and characterization of the oceans to achieve a complete inventory.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMore than half of the known marine fish species have had their conservation status assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and approximately a third of those assessments having been conducted since the first Assessment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOf the fish species with conservation assessments, around 6 per cent of bony fishes, nearly 50 per cent of elasmobranchs, 10 per cent of chimaeras and both species of coelacanths are threatened or near threatened with extinction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCapacity for documenting and understanding marine fish diversity continues to grow, but significant gaps remain for certain ecosystem groups (e.g., mesopelagic fishes) and in predicting responses to multiple simultaneous external stressors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e",false,true,1,5,2," How"],["B2449","2","What are the main employers and source of livelihoods in coastal States ?","Quais são os principais empregadores e fontes de sustento nos Estados costeiros?","What are the most important sources of employment and livelihood in coastal states?","Quais são as mais importantes fontes de emprego e sustento em estados costeiros?","Fisheries and aquaculture.","Pesca e aquicultura.","Fisheries and aquaculture.","Pesca e aquacultura.","","\u003ch1\u003eFood security and food safety\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSeafood products, including finfish, invertebrates and seaweeds, are a major component of food security around the world.

Even though they have different names, they form one single interconnected ocean system. The basins have been created over geological times by the movement of the tectonic plates across the Earth’s mantle. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles to the continental slopes leading down to the continental rises and the abyssal plains. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift-valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine, when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) have created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins, there are marginal seas, more or less separated from the main ocean basins by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges and formed by various processes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean mixes and circulates within those geological structures. Although the proportion of the different chemical components dissolved in seawater is essentially constant over time, that water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the seawater. Salinity varies according to the relative balance between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Differences in salinity and temperature of water masses can cause seawater to be stratified into separate layers. Such stratification can lead to variations in the distribution of both oxygen and nutrients, with an obvious variety of consequences in both cases for the biotas sensitive to those factors. A further variation is in the penetration of light, which controls where the photosynthesis on which nearly all ocean life depends can take place. Below a few tens of metres at the coastal level or a few hundred meters in the clearer open ocean, the ocean becomes dark and there is no photosynthesis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuperimposed on all this is a change in the acidity of the ocean.

In 2012, international tourism expenditure exceeded 1 billion dollars for the first time. Total expenditure on tourism, domestic as well as international, is several times that amount. The direct turnover of tourism contributed 2.9 per cent of gross world product in 2013, rising to 8.9 per cent when the multiplier effect on the rest of the economy is taken into account. The Middle East is the region where tourism plays the smallest part in the economy (6.4 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect), and the Caribbean is the region where it plays the largest part (13.9 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMost reports of tourism revenues do not differentiate revenues from tourism directly related to the sea and the coast from other types of tourism. Even where tourism in the coastal zone can be separated from tourism inland, it may be generated by the attractions of the sea and coast or its maritime history, as it may be based on other attractions not linked to the marine environment. Consequently, the value of ocean-related tourism is a matter of inference. However, coastal tourism is a major component of tourism everywhere. In small island and coastal States, coastal tourism is usually predominant because it can only take place in the coastal zone in those countries. Particularly noteworthy is the way in which international tourism is increasing in Asia and the Pacific, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of world tourism. This implies that pressures from tourism are becoming of significantly more concern in those regions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eTourism is also a significant component of employment.

When the distances over which the cargoes were carried are taken into account, the growth in ton-miles is even larger (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 2019). Recovery is still in progress and has been seriously affected by the massive drop in world trade caused by the COVID-19 crisis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch growth, however, has occurred against a weak competitive background for the international shipping industry. The economic crisis that took place from 2008 to 2011 occurred during a time when world shipping had commissioned a large increase in tonnage to meet the increased freight demand of the preceding years. The additional tonnage was delivered at a time when demand had started to reduce, with the result that, during the 2010s, the shipping industry was operating against a background of oversupply, which had the consequence of depressing freight rates. As measures to further control the pollutant emissions from ships take effect (from 2020), further pressures associated with implementing modifications to fleets will be placed on the shipping industry. To meet the new requirements (as detailed in chap.  11), ships must either purchase bunkers with a lower sulfur content (which may have a higher price, since the traditional ships’ bunkers have been the high-sulfur oils for which there was less demand) or retrofit scrubbers to clean the ships’ exhaust. Further economic pressures of that kind are described in chapter  11. The combined effect of continuing overcapacity and higher operating costs remains unclear (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFor many years, the quantities of cargo loaded in ports in developing countries were smaller than those unloaded in those countries, marking an imbalance in seaborne trade. By the time of the first Assessment, the quantities, on average, were nearly in balance and, since then, the quantities loaded in developing countries now exceed those unloaded. Even excluding China, as the single largest developing country importer/exporter, there is still an excess of unloading in developing countries (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eContainertraffic continues to be focused on the main East-West arteries across the northern hemisphere (Asia-Europe, trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic), which account for 40 per cent of all container shipping. Of the remaining 60 per  cent, 27 per  cent is intraregional, 13 per cent occurs across the other East-West routes in the northern hemisphere, 12 per cent is associated with traffic between southern hemisphere countries, and 8 per cent is associated with North-South traffic (UNCTAD, 2019). At the same time, there is a growing tendency to consolidate container shipping, so the combined market share of the top 10 container shipping lines increased from 68 per  cent in 2014 to 90 per cent in 2019. That is combined with a returning interest in container shipping lines integrating their operations with traffic between originators and ports and between ports and the ultimate destinations. Those developments have the ability to undermine competition and thus to result in higher transit costs (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe total world fleet of ships carrying all that cargo amounted to 96,295 ships in early 2019, accounting for 1.97 billion dead-weight tons of capacity. Bulk carriers and oil tankers maintained the largest market shares of vessels that dominated the world fleet, at 42.6 per cent of all vessels and 28.7 per cent of dead-weight tons, respectively. A large proportion of the world’s tonnage continues to be registered in a relatively small number of registries. Nearly 70 per cent of the world’s tonnage is registered in seven registries: Panama (17 per cent), Marshall Islands (12 per cent), Liberia (12 per cent), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (10 per  cent), Singapore (7 per  cent), Malta (6 per cent) and China (5 per cent). No other registry is responsible for more than 4 per  cent of the world’s tonnage (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, ownership and control of shipping continues to be concentrated in the hands of firms in a relatively small number of countries. In 2019, five economies accounted for more than 50 per  cent of the world tonnage: Greece, Japan, China, Singapore and Hong Kong, China. Between 2015 and 2019, Greece, Singapore, China and Hong Kong, China have increased the proportion that they own/control (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of new ships still remains very concentrated in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, which together represent 90 per cent of all cargo ship construction activity. The demolition of ships that have reached the end of their useful life likewise continues to be concentrated in the same countries as reported in the first Assessment. In 2018, 47.2 per cent of the total reported tonnage of propelled seagoing vessels of 100 gross tons and above that were sold for demolition were demolished in Bangladesh, 25.6 per  cent in India, 21.5 per  cent in Pakistan, 2.3 per  cent in Turkey and 2 per  cent in China, leaving 1.4 per cent for the rest of the world.

Overall, cargo shipping activity has dropped significantly: for example, trade from the European Union to China and the United States dropped in the first 31 weeks of 2020 by 47 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, compared with 2019; trade in the reverse directions has dropped by 26 per  cent and 38 per  cent, respectively (European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,4,2," How"],["B1997","2","Where has the total sea ice extent  been declining rapidly?","Onde a extensão total do gelo marítimo tem se reduzido rapidamente?","Where has the total sea ice extent seen rapid decline?","Onde a extensão total de gelo marítimo sofreu uma rápida redução?","It has been declining rapidly in the Arctic, but not in the Antarctic.","No Ártico tem se reduzido rapidamente, mas não no Antártico.","In the Arctic.","No Ártico.","","\u003cp\u003eGlobal surface ocean pH has declined on average by approximately 0.1 since the Industrial Revolution, an increase in acidity of about 30 per cent. Ocean pH is projected to decline by approximately an additional 0.3 over the next century unless global carbon emissions are significantly curtailed. The changes can be observed in extended ocean time series, and the rate of change is likely to be unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years. The time of emergence of the signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites and 16 to 41 years for coastal sites, making it necessary to commit to long-term observational records, especially in the coastal zone, where most commercially and culturally important marine resources reside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOceanic oxygen levels have declined in recent decades, with strong regional variations. While the overall oxygen content has decreased by about 2 per cent in five decades, oxygen in coastal areas or near oxygen minimum zones shows larger variations. Coastal changes are mostly fuelled by riverine run-off, and the open ocean changes are likely related to a combination of changes in ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Temperature-driven solubility decrease is responsible for most near-surface oxygen loss, while other processes have to be accountable for deep-ocean oxygen loss. A further decrease in oxygen in and near oxygen minimum zones can lead to climate feedback through consequent greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice covers 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation. Total sea ice extent has been declining rapidly in the Arctic, but trends are insignificant in the Antarctic.

Regionally, the spatial distribution of the trends is dramatic. In the Arctic, the summer trends are most striking in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, while, in the Antarctic, the summer trends show increases in the Weddell Sea and decreases in the West Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean.

This will certainly affect coastal areas that have not been exposed previously to the dangers caused by tropical cyclones.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eUltraviolet radiation and the ozone layer\u003ch2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun in the UV-B range (280-315 nanometres wavelength) has a wide range of potentially harmful effects, including the inhibition of primary production by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and function of plankton communities and alterations of the nitrogen cycle. The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere blocks most UV-B from reaching the ocean’s surface. Consequently, stratospheric ozone depletion since the 1970s has been a concern. International action (under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) to address that depletion has been taken, and the situation appears to have stabilized, although with some variation from year to year. Given those developments and the variations in the water depths to which UV-B penetrates, a consensus on the magnitude of the ozone-depletion effect on net primary production and nutrient cycling has yet to be reached.

One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future.

Numerous other voyaging canoes have been constructed in the Pacific and, in many places, knowledge of traditional wayfinding has been preserved. Fautasi races in Samoa and dragon boat races in China merge history and cultural traditions with health, fitness and competition.

In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, drivers are defined as any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly results in a change in an ecosystem (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services takes a similar approach in its global assessment, identifying drivers as direct human influences on nature and factors behind human choices that affect nature (Balvanera and others, 2019). The European Environment Agency considers only human-induced factors as drivers (European Environment Agency, 2005), while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines drivers within the context of global emissions as those elements that directly or indirectly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions (Blanco and others, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the context of the present Assessment, drivers have been characterized according to social, demographic and economic developments in societies, including corresponding changes in lifestyles and associated overall consumption and production patterns (European Environment Agency, 2019), that are applying pressures on the mar thus an increase in the demand for resources, including food, energy and natural resources such as rare earth elements, sand and metals.

In general, when smaller plankton account for most net primary production, as is typically the case in oligotrophic open-ocean waters (that is, areas where levels of nutrients are low), net primary production is lower and the microbial food web dominates energy flows and nutrient cycles.

Little, if anything, has been published about the total global coastal population since the early 2000s. Because of the significance of the impacts of sea level rise, studies since then have concentrated, in particular, on low-elevation coastal zones, which have a narrower scope (for example, Neumann and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eStudies in the early 2000s showed that, globally, there is a major concentration of population in the coastal zones. Figure I is based on the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population count grids for 2010 (Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), 2011). The project uses night-time satellite data of observed light sources to identify urban areas and reallocates census count data within administrative boundaries. The resulting map (figure I) shows that the global coastal population is concentrated mostly in East, South-East and South Asia. The evidence suggests that concentration in the coastal zone is increasing as a proportion of the total global population (Merkens and others, 2016). Nevertheless, access to the ocean, in particular for maritime transport, remains important for landlocked States.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eUrban areas near the coast reinforce the concentration: 40 per cent of the population within 100 km of the coast lives in 4 per cent of the land area within that distance (Small and Nicholls, 2003). Much of the concentration (about 90 per cent) is in coastal cities with populations of over 1 million. An analysis of such cities as recorded in The World’s Cities in 2018 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), 2018) is shown in table 1.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis thus shows that the main concentrations of urban coastal population are in East, South and South-East Asia, and that the most rapid rates of growth of such populations are in those regions and sub-Saharan Africa.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the other end of the scale are tens of thousands of smaller coastal communities around the world. The number of, and populations in, such communities are unknown. It seems likely, however, that the number of such communities along the coasts of the world is high, and that official local government units often contain many more than one community. For example, in Nova Scotia, Canada, a recent assessment indicates that, while there are about 50 official municipalities, there are approximately 1,000 separate coastal communities (Charles, 2020). Accordingly, there is great diversity among coastal communities across the globe, notably in differences between the big cities noted above and rural communities, where such economic activities as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and tourism are typically prominent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the size of the community, it often plays a role in stewardship of the coast. Indeed, the role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly recognized and valued, in terms of many local initiatives in ocean conservation, around the world, that often succeed both in improving livelihoods and protecting communities (Charles, 2017; Charles and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly valued. Many coastal communities around the world and their smallscale fishers have undertaken a large number of local initiatives in ocean conservation, often with considerable success. The successes of those communities are often based on local knowledge, structures and cooperation (Charles, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability of coastal communities to the impacts of climate change is of increasing concern. It is relevant to the planning of tourism development, in particular in small island developing States with economies that are dependent on tourism, and fisheries management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that, under current trends of the increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change, the risks of erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization and cascading impacts owing to mean sea level rise and extreme weather events, among others, are projected to increase significantly throughout the present century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019). Coastal communities located in the Arctic, in low-lying (often deltaic) States, such as Bangladesh and Guyana, in paths frequented by cyclones or hurricanes and in densely populated megacities are especially vulnerable. On the other hand, there appear to be health benefits from living in the coastal zone (see chap. 8B on human health as affected by the ocean).\u003c/p\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall coastal communities are not just physically vulnerable to climate change impacts; they are also socially vulnerable, in particular in rural areas (Charles and others, 2019). Rural coastal communities are vulnerable to weather events and flooding as a result of geographic location and limited access to health care, goods, transportation and other services. Sensitivity to market fluctuations from their dependence on natural resources, and poverty, limited economic opportunities and losses of populations, create problems when trying to adapt (Armitage and Tam, 2007; Amundsen, 2015; Bennett and others, 2016; Metcalf and others, 2015; May, 2019c). Such factors strain material assets, as well as the social and moral foundations that facilitate collective problem-solving (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019a). Communities are more likely to mobilize collective resources in response to threats when people actively care about each other and the place they live (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019b; Wilkinson, 1991). That may be a function of attachment to the history, culture or environmental context of a place and/or the people in a place. Those attachments can become potential sources of resistance to change in contexts of low social diversity and slow population change, or the basis for conflict in contexts of high social diversity and fast population change (Graham and others, 2018; May, 2019b, 2019c). The combined effect of physical and social vulnerability on community capacities is particularly challenging at a time when collective action efforts for mitigation and adaptation are more important than ever (May, 2019b, 2019c).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, for our most vulnerable communities, many of which are coastal, transformative mitigation and adaptation is necessary to assuage the worst impacts of climate change. Incremental change is no longer seen as a possibility by most States: more radical action is thought to be needed to reduce the impacts of and adapt to a changing climate. Responses to threats from climate change are varied and include a mix of hard and soft coastal defences. Built infrastructure, such as sea walls or dykes, is widely used but tends to be more costly and maintenance-dependent than ecosystem-based measures, such as marshes, mangroves, reefs or seagrass (see also sect. 7.3). Having limited data inhibits estimates of the cost effectiveness of both hard and soft measures, especially across geographies and scales (Oppenheimer and others, 2019), although State-level estimates exist (see, for example, Environment Agency of the United Kingdom, 2015). The World Bank estimated that, without concrete climate and development action, over 143 million people could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Rigaud and others, 2018). To address those problems, in coastal areas, integrated coastal zone management is widely regarded as an effective approach to climate change and other drivers (Nicholls and Klein, 2005; Nicholls and others, 2007; see also chap. 27 on management approaches).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,4,5," Why"],["B2556","2","What percentage of the planet is covered by marine environment?","Qual porcentagem do planeta é coberta pelo ambiente marinho?","What is the porportion of the planet that is covered by the ocean?","Qual a proporção do planeta que é coberta pelo ambiente marinho?","the marine environment covers seven tenths of the planet","O ambiente marinho cobre sete décimos do planeta","The marine environment covers 70% of the planet","O ambiente marinho cobre  70% do planeta","","\u003ch1\u003eIntegrated management of human activities affecting the ocean\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regular Process is to provide an assessment of all the aspects of the marine environment relevant to sustainable development: environmental, economic and social. Even though the marine environment covers seven tenths of the planet, it is still only one component of the overall Earth system. As far as environmental aspects are concerned, major drivers of the pressures producing change in the ocean are to be found outside the marine environment. In particular, most of the major drivers of anthropogenic climate change are land-based. Likewise, the main drivers of increased pressures on marine biodiversity and marine environmental quality include the demand for food for terrestrial populations, international trade in products from land-based agriculture and industries and coastal degradation from land-based development and land-based sources.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThus, as far as social and economic aspects of the marine environment are concerned, many of the most significant drivers are outside the scope of the present Assessment.

The extent of cruising and other types of tourism is determined by the levels around the world of disposable income and leisure time. The patterns of trade in fish and other seafood and in cultural goods from the ocean are set by the location of supply and demand and the relative purchasing power of local markets as compared with international ones, modified by national and international rules on the exploitation of those resources.

There are places around the world where local action has been taken to prevent or discourage the consumption of contaminated fish and other seafood. In other places, monitoring suggests that levels of contamination dangerous for human health are being reached. In yet other places, there are inadequate monitoring systems to check on risks of that kind. Ensuring linkages between adequate systems for controlling the discharge and emissions of hazardous substances and the systems for controlling the quality of fish and other seafood available for human consumption is therefore an important issue.

Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion.

Based on global estimates of the number of tourists who go swimming, and WHO estimates of the relative risks at various levels of contamination, the study estimated that bathing in polluted seas causes some 250 million cases of gastroenteritis and upper respiratory disease every year and that some of those people affected would be disabled over the longer term. Measured by adding up the total years of healthy life that are lost through disease, disability and death, the worldwide burden of disease incurred by bathing in contaminated seawater is some 400,000 disability-adjusted life-years (a standard measure of time lost owing to premature death and time spent disabled by disease), comparable to the global impacts of diphtheria and leprosy. GESAMP and WHO estimated that the cost to society, worldwide, amounted to about $1.6 billion per year (GESAMP, 2001).

Human faecal matter in water bodies constitutes the greatest public health threat because humans are reservoirs for many bacteria, parasites and viruses that are dangerous to other humans and can lead to a variety of illnesses. The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation. Drawing together the scientific work in the field, in 2003, WHO published Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments: Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003). More recently, WHO, with the support of the European Union, prepared recommendations on scientific, analytical and epidemiological developments relevant to the parameters for bathing-water quality, with special reference to Europe (WHO, 2018). WHO has indicated that the recommendations will inform the revision of the 2003 Guidelines (WHO, 2020). However, achievement of such standards requires adequate planning and infrastructure. Even where, as in some parts of India, strenuous efforts are being made to install properly operating sewage treatment systems, problems persist. For example, in Goa, a major tourist location, faecal coliform bacteria exceeded the relevant standards at all 10 of the beaches monitored (Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring of bathing water will not achieve its aim of improving public health without improvements in the communication to the public of the findings so that they are readily understandable.

Similar systems are found in various Australian States (New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (NSW-DPIE), 2020; South Australia Environment Protection Agency (SA-EPA), 2020) and in the United States (WHOI, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change may be influencing the prevalence of microbial infections (Deeb and others, 2018; Konrad and others, 2017).

Because of their geography, some countries with large tourism industries, such as Greece, inevitably have a very large proportion of that industry in coastal areas. Elsewhere, evidence from different regions of the world continues to show that coastal tourism remains a major component of overall tourism.

Overall, coastal destinations were dominated substantially by domestic tourists: 9.8 million domestic tourism trips as compared with 1.6 million international tourist trips; tourism activity is particularly concentrated around Cape Town and in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality (which includes Durban), which in 2015 together accounted for 75 per  cent of total tourism spending in South African coastal areas (Rogerson and Rogerson, 2018, 2019). \u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ol\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eInternational travel and associated tourism play a major role in many parts of the world, in particular in the “sun, sea and sand” type of tourism. The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4). The absolute scale of tourism in different regions also varies significantly. Collectively, some of the countries in South Asia and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Pakistan) achieved a 119 per  cent increase in inbound international tourist numbers between 2011 and 2017 (although from a relatively low base), far outstripping other regions. Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019). The Middle East and North Africa has experienced relatively low growth in tourist numbers, but a substantial growth in tourist income, suggesting that the tourist industry is offering more upmarket experiences (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic tourism dominates the tourist market in most major economies (figure V), with 73 per  cent of expenditure on tourism and travel derived from domestic sources globally (World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), 2018). While it will include much tourism and travel that does not have an impact on the marine environment, coastal tourism is, as noted above, a major component of total tourism. Domestic tourism has grown generally in line with total tourism, and growth rates are estimated at over 10 per cent per year in many Asia-Pacific countries, such as China, Malaysia and the Philippines, over the period 2011–2017 (WTTC, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2016","2","What are the consequences of climate change in the way humans live nowadays?","Quais consequências as mudanças climáticas terão sobre a forma que os humanos vivem hoje?","How and where global populations live will be influenced by climate change?","Como e onde as populações globais vivem serão influenciados pelas mudanças climáticas?","People will redistribute themselves to more liveable regions, increasing urban footprints in those regions.","As pessoas irão se redistribuir para regiões mais habitáveis, aumentando a ocupação urbana dessas regiões.

Under the same scenarios, populations in low-density to medium-density areas (\u003c1,000 persons km2) are projected to decline, while those in higher-density areas are projected to increase (Jones and O’Neill, 2016), with an expansion of urban footprints in high-density areas and an increasing strain on associated infrastructure. How and where global populations live and their associated impacts on the environment will be influenced by climate change in many ways. As areas become increasingly unliveable as a result of declining precipitation, increasing temperatures, sea level rise and the loss of ecosystem goods and services, people will redistribute themselves to more liveable regions, increasing urban footprints in those regions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the global population ages and overall growth slows, the size of the labour force is expected to decline, with an impact on the global economy.

How global economies respond to the influence of changing population growth and demographics will depend on public policy, such as introducing policies that reduce barriers to the employment of women, and their ability to use advances in technologies to maintain productivity.

The rapid increase in the demand for water, food, land and power has led to human interventions, such as the construction of large dams, deforestation, intensive agriculture expansion, urbanization, infrastructural construction and sand mining. Such human activities have placed those systems under immense stress, leading to large-scale and irreversible changes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (2018), globally, there are 59,071 dams with heights of more than 15 m and related reservoirs of more than 3 million m3. The largest densities of hydropower dams are found in South America, South Asia and Northern Europe. The largest dams, including those have been built, are under construction or are planned, are located in the Mekong River basin, the Amazon River basin and the Congo River basin (Kondolf and others, 2014; Warner and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of dams and reservoirs can reduce the sediment supply to the coast by different degrees (Slagel and Griggs, 2008), sometimes by more than 50 per cent (Besset and others, 2019), leading to the erosion of deltas and adjacent coasts. The reduction in sediment supply to the coasts is expected to increase greatly in the twenty-first century (Dunn and others, 2018), by 50 to 100 per cent (Kondolf and others, 2014; Besset and others, 2019). For example, in the Pearl River, China, the construction of two mega dams (Yangtan and Longtan) has reduced the fluvial sediment supply to the coast by 70  per  cent over the period 1992–2013 (Ranasinghe and others, 2019). Kondolf and others (2014) found that 140 dams had been built, were under construction or were planned for the Mekong River or its tributaries. Under a “definite future”, if 38 dams that are planned or are under construction are actually completed, the cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta would be 51 per cent; and if all dams that are planned and under construction are completed, there would be a cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta of 96 per cent. That would lead to a serious decay of mangrove systems and, as a consequence, the erosion of the coast and irreversible changes in the surrounding ecosystem. On the other hand, there are substantial efforts in States to remove large dams, such as the Elwha Dam in Washington State, United States (Warrick and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSand mined from rivers, beaches and coastal seabeds is used for land reclamation, beach nourishment and industry (Bendixen and others, 2019).

Presently, coastal beach and seabed sand mining is common practice in many countries, although it is sometimes illegal.

The spiritual significance of those marine species and places may be part of their self-identification and reflects their beliefs about the origins of their culture. That is particularly true of island cultures, which are often intimately bound to the sea. Expressions of loss of, or threats to, such cultures and identities are readily found, but the marine component is not easily separated.

That system is influenced by the seasonal changes caused by the Earth’s tilted rotation with respect to the sun. Variations in sea-surface temperature among different parts of the ocean are important in creating winds, areas of high and low air pressure and storms (including the highly damaging hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones). In their turn, winds help to shape the surface currents of the ocean, which transport heat from the tropics towards the poles. The ocean surface water arriving in the cold polar regions partly freezes, rendering the remainder more saline and thus heavier. That more saline water sinks to the bottom and flows towards the equator, starting a return flow to the tropics: the meridional overturning circulation, also called the thermohaline circulation. A further overall forcing factor is the movements generated by the tidal system, predominantly driven by the gravitational effect of the moon and sun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe movements of seawater help to control the distribution of nutrients in the ocean. The ocean enjoys both a steady (and, in some places, excessive) input from land of inorganic nutrients needed for plant growth (especially nitrogen, phosphorus and their compounds, but also lesser amounts of other vital nutrients) and a continuous recycling of all the nutrients already in the ocean through biogeochemical processes, including bacterial action. Areas of upwelling, where nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, are particularly important, because they result in a high level of primary production from photosynthesis by phytoplankton in the zone of light penetration, combining carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the other nutrients, and releasing oxygen back into the atmosphere. Whether in the water column or when it sinks to the seabed, that primary production constitutes the basis on which the oceanic food web is built, through each successive layer up to the top predators (large fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles, seabirds and, through capture fisheries, humans).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe distribution of living marine resources around the world is the outcome of that complex interplay of geological forms, ocean currents, nutrient fluxes, weather, seasons and sunlight. Not surprisingly, the resulting distribution of living resources reflects that complexity.

Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4).

Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019).

Based on global estimates of the number of tourists who go swimming, and WHO estimates of the relative risks at various levels of contamination, the study estimated that bathing in polluted seas causes some 250 million cases of gastroenteritis and upper respiratory disease every year and that some of those people affected would be disabled over the longer term. Measured by adding up the total years of healthy life that are lost through disease, disability and death, the worldwide burden of disease incurred by bathing in contaminated seawater is some 400,000 disability-adjusted life-years (a standard measure of time lost owing to premature death and time spent disabled by disease), comparable to the global impacts of diphtheria and leprosy. GESAMP and WHO estimated that the cost to society, worldwide, amounted to about $1.6 billion per year (GESAMP, 2001). Furthermore, harmful or toxic algal blooms can induce serious neurological disease and also have major financial impacts (Bechard, 2020; Diaz and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common pollutants tend to come from one of two places: humans or animals. Human faecal matter in water bodies constitutes the greatest public health threat because humans are reservoirs for many bacteria, parasites and viruses that are dangerous to other humans and can lead to a variety of illnesses. The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation. Drawing together the scientific work in the field, in 2003, WHO published Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments: Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003). More recently, WHO, with the support of the European Union, prepared recommendations on scientific, analytical and epidemiological developments relevant to the parameters for bathing-water quality, with special reference to Europe (WHO, 2018). WHO has indicated that the recommendations will inform the revision of the 2003 Guidelines (WHO, 2020). However, achievement of such standards requires adequate planning and infrastructure. Even where, as in some parts of India, strenuous efforts are being made to install properly operating sewage treatment systems, problems persist. For example, in Goa, a major tourist location, faecal coliform bacteria exceeded the relevant standards at all 10 of the beaches monitored (Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring of bathing water will not achieve its aim of improving public health without improvements in the communication to the public of the findings so that they are readily understandable. The current European Union legislation on bathing water (European Union, 2006) provides for standardized ways of publicizing the results of the monitoring that is required. Similar systems are found in various Australian States (New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (NSW-DPIE), 2020; South Australia Environment Protection Agency (SA-EPA), 2020) and in the United States (WHOI, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change may be influencing the prevalence of microbial infections (Deeb and others, 2018; Konrad and others, 2017).

Sophisticated techniques now make it possible to drill multiple wells from a single drilling platform, while advances in real-time fibre-optic monitoring of the well bore is optimizing the reservoir performance and mitigating equipment failure risks (Beaubouef, 2019). Similarly, the use of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools is enhancing data analysis for detecting equipment breakdown and improving operational efficiency (Husseini, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of FPSO vessels enables drilling in areas further offshore and without ready access to a pipeline network to transport oil and gas onshore. It has also opened previously inaccessible hostile environments, in particular in the higher latitudes and in the Arctic, to exploration and development. FPSO vessels are equipped to store hydrocarbons onboard and periodically transfer their load to tankers for transportation onshore. They can also disconnect from their moorings in case of adverse weather conditions, such as cyclones and hurricanes. Once the reservoirs are depleted, an FPSO vessel can be redeployed to a new prospective site. The global market for FPSO vessels is currently boosted by large investments in deepwater exploration and development in such areas as the coast of Brazil (Rystad Energy, 2019). Meanwhile, FPSO vessel design is evolving to enhance safety, minimize complexity and reduce fabrication and operation costs (Barton, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch technological advances have enabled exploration and production at uncharted depths and distance from shore.

The growth has continued, reaching 51,700 in the 2017–2018 season (an increase of a further 40 per cent), with a forecast of further growth to 55,750 in the 2018–2019 season. Over 80 per cent of the tourists land on Antarctica (International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), 2018). Passenger landings and marine traffic are highly concentrated at a few specific locations, in particular along the Antarctic Peninsula’s south-western coast. Growth in Antarctic tourism is closely correlated with the economies of the countries sending the most visitors to the region: 60 per cent of the tourists come from the United States (33 per cent), China (16 per cent) and Australia (11 per cent). The proportion of tourists from China increased significantly between 2013 and 2014 and between 2017 and 2018. Markets for Antarctic travel are probably far from saturated, and demand is therefore likely to continue to grow (Bender and others, 2016).

The goal of most food safety systems is to avoid risk and prevent problems at the source. The risks come from contamination from pathogens (particularly from discharges of untreated sewage and animal waste) and toxins (often from algal blooms). The severity of the risk also depends on individual health, consumption levels and susceptibility. There are international guidelines to address those risks but substantial resources are required in order to continue to build the capacity to implement and monitor safety protocols from the water to the consumer.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2408","2","How depth in the ocean the photosynthesis takes place?","A que profundidade no oceano ocorre a fotossíntese?","How many meters in the ocean can photosynthesis take place?","Até quantos metros no oceano pode-se ocorrer a fotossíntese?","The upper 200 metres of the ocean are where most photosynthesis takes place","Os 200 metros superiores do oceano são onde ocorre a maior parte da fotossíntese","200 metres","200 metros","","\u003cp\u003eThe new map shows the way in which the ocean consists of four main basins (the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean) between the tectonic plates that form the continents. The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean circulates within these geological structures. This water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the sea water. Salinity varies according to the relativity between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Sea areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, with large amounts of freshwater coming from rivers and relatively low evaporation have low salinity – 8 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively, as compared with the global average of 35 parts per thousand (HELCOM 2010, Black Sea Commission 2008). The Red Sea, in contrast, with low riverine input and high insolation, and therefore high evaporation, has a mean surface salinity as high as 42.5 parts per thousand (Heilman et al 2009). Seawater can also be stratified into separate layers, with different salinities and different temperatures. Such stratification can lead to variations in both the oxygen content and nutrient content, with critical consequences in both cases for the biota dependent on them. A further variation is in the penetration of light. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis of inorganic carbon (mainly CO2) into the organic carbon of plants and mixotrophic species1 . Even clear water reduces the level of light that can penetrate by about 90 per cent for every 75 metres of depth. Below 200 metres depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis (Widder 2014). The upper 200 metres of the ocean are therefore where most photosynthesis takes place (the euphotic zone). Variations in light level in the water column and on the sea bed are caused by seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion. Where turbidity occurs, it can reduce the penetration of light by up to 95 per cent, and thus reduce the level of photosynthesis which can take place (Anthony 2004).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,4,4," How"],["B2519","2","Where is the amount of litter increasing?","Onde a quantidade de lixo está aumentando?","Where is the amount of garbage increasing?","Onde a quantidade de dejetos está aumentando?","In remote and unpopulated areas.","Em áreas remotas e despovoadas.","In remote and unpopulated areas","Em áreas remotas e despovoadas","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003ePlastics now represent the major share of marine litter or marine debris.\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eMost marine litter is from land-based sources, resulting from poor waste management practices, especially in some rural and developing regions.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eMarine litter is present in all marine habitats, affecting the environment and marine organisms through entanglement, ingestion and the rafting of invasive species.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eAmounts of marine litter are increasing in remote and unpopulated areas.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eTime series data are needed to assess and monitor impacts of marine litter, including microplastics and nanoplastics.\u003c/li\u003e  \n\n\u003cli\u003eAlthough a decreasing trend is observed, there is a need to harmonize reporting on dumping at sea.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," Where"],["B2468","2","Why will food pressure increase in 2030?","Porque irá aumentar a pressão por alimentos em 2030?","Why will the pressure on food sectors certainly increase in 2030?","Por que a pressão sobre os setores alimentícios certamente aumentará em 2030?","Because in 2030 the world population will exceed 8.5 billion people in the world","Pois em 2030 a população mundial será superior a 8.5 bilhões de pessoas no mundo","Because the global population is predicted to reach 8.5 billion in 2030.","Porque a previsão é que a população global alcance 8,5 bilhões em 2030.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eGlobal aquaculture production in 2017 (animals and plants) was recorded as 111.9 million tons, with an estimated firstsale value of $249.6 billion.

Nevertheless, it continues to grow at a faster rate than other major food production sectors. Annual growth declined to a moderate 5.8  per  cent during the period from 2000 to 2016, although double-digit growth still occurred in a small number of countries, in particular in Africa, from 2006 to 2010.

While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019).

Commercial fisheries are the most serious pressure at sea that the world’s seabirds face, although there is evidence of some reductions of by-catch in some key fisheries. Each year, incidental by-catch in longline fisheries is estimated to kill at least 160,000 albatrosses and petrels, mainly in the southern hemisphere.

Food webs change because of altered encounter rates and the species-specific effects of low oxygen on the feeding efficiencies of predators and escape behaviours of prey. Energy transfer to tolerant animals, such as gelatinous species, can increase (Keister and Tuttle, 2013). The roles of vision (McCormick and Levin, 2017) and carnivory (Sperling and others, 2016) can decline within low oxygen areas because those activities are energy intensive. In contrast, predation can intensify above low oxygen zones as visual feeders are forced into shallower waters with higher light levels (Koslow and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDeclining ocean oxygen is expected to negatively affect a wide range of biological and ecological processes. The magnitude of the effects will vary among species and processes, however, and whether the magnitude of responses will be directly proportional to the magnitude of oxygen decline is uncertain. Some effects of oxygen decline are dependent on direct exposure within low-oxygen waters, while others involve the movement of organisms and material (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, greenhouse gases) among locations that vary in oxygen content, and still other effects are primarily dependent on oxygen levels at particular locations that are critical for a species or life stage. Many responses involve threshold oxygen levels at which biological functions can no longer be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biomass and diversity of eukaryotic organisms tend to decline and species composition changes as oxygen declines (Gallo and Levin, 2016). As low-oxygen waters expand, tolerant species can expand their depth range, while ranges of species that are more sensitive contract (Sato and others, 2017). The relative abundance of species within systems reflects variation in species’ tolerances to low oxygen and other co-stressors (Koslow and others, 2018). Organisms, including crustaceans and fish adapted to low-oxygen environments, can reach very high densities in low-oxygen areas (Pineda and others, 2016; Gallo and others, 2019). However, in naturally low-oxygen habitats, such as oxygen minimum zones, even very small changes (representing less than 1  per  cent of the oxygen content of well-oxygenated surface waters) can result in the exclusion of species that would otherwise be abundant (Wishner and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,5," Why"],["B2142","2","What are the proportion of men and women employed in the fishery sector worlwide?","Qual é a proporção de homens e mulheres empregados no setor pesqueiro em todo o mundo?","Which share of the fishery sector workers of the world are women?","Qual parcela dos trabalhadores do setor da pesca no mundo são mulheres?","85 per cent men and 15 per cent women.","85 por cento homens e 15 por cento mulheres.","It is estimated that more than fifteen per cent of the fishing sector workers are women.","Estima-se que mais de quinze por cento dos trabalhadores do setor da pesca são mulheres.","","\u003ch1\u003eDistribution of ocean benefits and disbenefits\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eDevelopments in employment and income from fisheries and aquaculture\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe global harvest of marine capture fisheries has expanded rapidly since the early 1950s and is currently estimated to be about 80 million tons a year.

Women are estimated to account for more than 15 per cent of people employed in the fishery sector.

Severe, prolonged or repeated bleaching can lead to the death of coral colonies. An increase of only 1°C to 2°C above the normal local seasonal maximum can induce bleaching.

Today 44 per cent of the world's population lives on or within 150 kilometres from the coast (United Nations Atlas of Oceans). However this fundamental connection between nature and people has only very recently been incorporated into trans-disciplinary thinking on how we manage and account for the human benefits we get from nature. Today, when a product taken from an ecosystem1 , for example, fibres, timber or fish, enters the economic cycle (i.e., a part of the human system), it receives a monetary value that accounts at least for the costs associated with its extraction and mobilization. If that natural product is the result of cultivation, as in the case of agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, the monetary value also includes the production costs. However, the extraction of natural products and other human benefits from ecosystems has implicit costs of production and other ancillary costs associated with preserving the integrity of the natural production system itself. Traditionally these benefits and costs have been hidden within the “natural system,” and are not accounted for financially; such hidden costs and benefits are considered “externalities” by neoclassical economists. While the neoclassical economic toolbox includes non-market valuation approaches, an ecosystem services approach emphasizes that ‘price’ is not equal to “value” and highlights human well-being, as a normative goal. The emergence and evolution of the ecosystem services concept offers an explicit attempt to better capture and reflect these hidden or unaccounted benefits and associated costs when the natural “production” system is negatively affected by human activities. The ecosystem services approach has proven to be very useful in the management of multi-sector processes and already informs many management and regulatory processes around the world (e.g. United Kingdom National Ecosystem Assessment, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,false,3,1,1," When"],["B1979","2","How much of the biomass in the ocean could be affected by climate change?","Quanto da biomassa presente no oceano poderia ser afetada pela mudança climática?","What is the percentage of the biomass in the ocean that could be affected by climate change?","Qual é a porcentagem da biomassa presente no oceano que poderia ser afetada pela mudança climática?","60 percent","60 por cento","Up to 60 per cent.","Mais de 60 porcento.","","\u003ch1\u003eImpacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eChanges in seasonal life cycles in the ocean\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been predicted under some climate change scenarios that up to 60 per cent of the current biomass in the ocean could be affected, either positively or negatively, resulting in disruptions to many existing ecosystem services.

The movement of species between the Pacific and the Atlantic demonstrates the scale of the potential impact. Those routes are shorter and may be more economic, but shipping brings with it increased risks of marine pollution both from acute disasters and chronic pollution and the potential introduction of invasive non-native species. The very low rate at which bacteria can break down spilled oil in polar conditions and the general low recovery rate of polar ecosystems mean that damage from such pollution would be very serious. Furthermore, the response and clear-up infrastructure found in other ocean basins is largely lacking today around the Arctic Ocean. Those factors would make such problems even worse.

Based on figures from 2011, the economic costs of marine plastic, in relation to marine natural capital, are conservatively conjectured to be between $3,300 and $33,000 per ton per year (Beaumont and others, 2019). While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019). More recently (McIlgorm and others, 2020), a ninefold increase in the direct economic costs of marine litter was found from 2009 to 2015, reaching $10.8 billion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to indirect impacts (i.e., on biodiversity and ecosystems), beach litter is perhaps the most visible direct impact and affects the patrimonial value of coastal areas that can be translated as the financial expenditure of cleaning up (UNEP, 2019).

As a result of changes in the heating of different parts of the ocean, patterns of variation in heat distribution across the ocean (such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation) are also changing. Those changes in patterns result in significant changes in weather patterns on land. Water masses are also moving differently in areas over continental shelves, with consequent effects on the distribution of species.

The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere blocks most UV-B from reaching the ocean’s surface. Consequently, stratospheric ozone depletion since the 1970s has been a concern. International action (under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) to address that depletion has been taken, and the situation appears to have stabilized, although with some variation from year to year. Given those developments and the variations in the water depths to which UV-B penetrates, a consensus on the magnitude of the ozone-depletion effect on net primary production and nutrient cycling has yet to be reached.

Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

Nutrients that are adsorbed onto the surface of particles are likely to fall into sediments, from where they may either be remobilised by water movement or settle permanently.

Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries.

Based on one-minute maximum sustained wind speed, the cyclonic disturbances are categorized into tropical depressions (≤ 17 m/s), tropical storms (18–32 m/s) and tropical cyclones (≥ 33 m/s, category 1 to category 5) (Knutson and others, 2010). A tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone, depending on geographic location.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnthropogenic climate change has increased precipitation, winds and extreme sea level events associated with a number of observed tropical cyclones. For example, studies have shown that the rainfall intensity of tropical cyclone (Hurricane) Harvey increased by at least 8 per cent (8–19 per cent) owing to climate change (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Van Oldenborgh and others, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). There is emerging evidence of a number of regional changes in tropical cyclone behaviour, such as an increase in the annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades, extremely severe tropical cyclones occurring in the Arabian Sea, cyclones making landfall in East and South-East Asia, an increase in frequency of moderately large storm surge events in the United States since 1923 and a decrease in frequency of severe tropical cyclones making landfall in eastern Australia since the late 1800s. There is low confidence that they represent detectable anthropogenic signals. Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and flooding, have increased in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean by about 1.0 cm per year and 0.8 cm per year over the period 1985–2018 (Young and Ribal, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAn increase in the average intensity of tropical cyclones, and the associated average precipitation rates, is projected for a 2°C global temperature rise, although there is low confidence in future frequency changes at the global scale (Yamada and others, 2017).

Projections suggest that the proportion of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones will increase (Knutson and others, 2015; Park and others, 2017).

Overall, coastal destinations were dominated substantially by domestic tourists: 9.8 million domestic tourism trips as compared with 1.6 million international tourist trips; tourism activity is particularly concentrated around Cape Town and in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality (which includes Durban), which in 2015 together accounted for 75 per  cent of total tourism spending in South African coastal areas (Rogerson and Rogerson, 2018, 2019). \u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ol\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eInternational travel and associated tourism play a major role in many parts of the world, in particular in the “sun, sea and sand” type of tourism. The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4). The absolute scale of tourism in different regions also varies significantly. Collectively, some of the countries in South Asia and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Pakistan) achieved a 119 per  cent increase in inbound international tourist numbers between 2011 and 2017 (although from a relatively low base), far outstripping other regions. Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019). The Middle East and North Africa has experienced relatively low growth in tourist numbers, but a substantial growth in tourist income, suggesting that the tourist industry is offering more upmarket experiences (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic tourism dominates the tourist market in most major economies (figure V), with 73 per  cent of expenditure on tourism and travel derived from domestic sources globally (World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), 2018).

Food webs change because of altered encounter rates and the species-specific effects of low oxygen on the feeding efficiencies of predators and escape behaviours of prey. Energy transfer to tolerant animals, such as gelatinous species, can increase (Keister and Tuttle, 2013). The roles of vision (McCormick and Levin, 2017) and carnivory (Sperling and others, 2016) can decline within low oxygen areas because those activities are energy intensive. In contrast, predation can intensify above low oxygen zones as visual feeders are forced into shallower waters with higher light levels (Koslow and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDeclining ocean oxygen is expected to negatively affect a wide range of biological and ecological processes. The magnitude of the effects will vary among species and processes, however, and whether the magnitude of responses will be directly proportional to the magnitude of oxygen decline is uncertain. Some effects of oxygen decline are dependent on direct exposure within low-oxygen waters, while others involve the movement of organisms and material (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, greenhouse gases) among locations that vary in oxygen content, and still other effects are primarily dependent on oxygen levels at particular locations that are critical for a species or life stage. Many responses involve threshold oxygen levels at which biological functions can no longer be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biomass and diversity of eukaryotic organisms tend to decline and species composition changes as oxygen declines (Gallo and Levin, 2016). As low-oxygen waters expand, tolerant species can expand their depth range, while ranges of species that are more sensitive contract (Sato and others, 2017). The relative abundance of species within systems reflects variation in species’ tolerances to low oxygen and other co-stressors (Koslow and others, 2018). Organisms, including crustaceans and fish adapted to low-oxygen environments, can reach very high densities in low-oxygen areas (Pineda and others, 2016; Gallo and others, 2019). However, in naturally low-oxygen habitats, such as oxygen minimum zones, even very small changes (representing less than 1  per  cent of the oxygen content of well-oxygenated surface waters) can result in the exclusion of species that would otherwise be abundant (Wishner and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,5,3," What"],["B2177","2","What is the global historical recurrence for disasters in the \"IPGO - offshore oil and gas industry\"?\n","Qual a recorrência histórica global para os desastres na \"IPGO - indústria de petróleo e gás offshore\"?  \n","","","One every 17 years.\n","Um a cada 17 anos.\n","About once every 17 years","Cerca de uma vez a cada 17 anos","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOffshore hydrocarbon industries\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor disasters in the offshore oil and gas industry have a global, historical recurrence of one about every 17 years.

The other main harmful inputs from that sector are drilling cuttings (contaminated with drilling muds) resulting from the drilling of exploration and production wells, “produced water” (the water contaminated with hydrocarbons that comes up from wells, either of natural origin or through having been injected to enhance hydrocarbon recovery), and various chemicals that are used and discharged offshore in the course of exploration and exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThose materials can be harmful to marine life under certain circumstances.

Over the same period, catches of pinnipeds and other cetaceans in the northern hemisphere have remained relatively stable overall (North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), 2019; International Whaling Commission (IWC), 2019). Catches of baleen whales in the western North Pacific have remained broadly stable since the first Assessment (IWC, 2019, catches taken under special permits) and catches in Antarctic waters were suspended in 2019 (IWC, 2019). Regulated subsistence hunting of marine mammals remains stable (NAMMCO, 2019; IWC, 2019). Two intergovernmental organizations continue to provide a forum for discussions on and the assessment and management of catches of marine mammals: IWC, established in 1946, and NAMMCO, established in 1992.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBy-caught marine mammals can complement fishery catches for human consumption. This practice can be further complemented by hunting or the use of stranded animals in some countries (Robards and Reeves, 2011). Marine mammals used in such a way has been termed “aquatic wild meat” or “marine bushmeat”, the latter as an analogy with terrestrial bushmeat used to support food security in deprived regions (Cosentino and Fisher, 2016; Clapham and Van Waerebeek, 2007). The catch and consumption of coastal species in lower latitudes are likely to have increased (Robards and Reeves, 2011), in particular in South-East Asia and West Africa (Porter and Lai, 2017; Liu and others, 2019; Mintzer and others, 2018; Van Waerebeek and others, 2017), where the sustainability of such practices is often unknown. As habitat change associated with climate change redistributes species and has a potential impact on population abundances (Moore and Reeves, 2018), communities relying on the harvesting of marine mammals for food are also likely to be affected, resulting in future food security challenges (Brinkman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine mammals remain culturally significant, with objects created from body parts and as part of the imagery of coastal traditions and cultures.

Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B1992","2","does the open flaring of unwanted or excess gas from production platforms affect air quality?","A queima aberta de gás indesejado ou em excesso das plataformas de produção afeta a qualidade do ar?","Does the open flaring of unintended or in excess gases from production platforms impact air quality?","A queima livre de gases não desejados ou em excesso das plataformas de produção impacta a qualidade do ar?","Yes, the open flaring affects air quality","Sim, a queima aberta de gás prejudica a qualidade do ar.","Yes","Sim","","\u003ch1\u003eEnvironmental impacts\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOffshore oil and gas exploration and development practices have evolved significantly in terms of minimizing impacts on the surrounding environment, but operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts still occur. Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment.

The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019).

That rise is due in part to anthropogenic warming, causing ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and of the polar continental ice sheets. Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion.

As a result, sea levels will rise more than the global mean in some regions, and will actually fall in others. A 4°C warming by 2100 (which is predicted in the high-end emissions scenario in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) would lead, by the end of that period, to a median sea-level rise of nearly 1 metre above the 1980 to 1999 levels.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOcean acidification\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eRising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are resulting in increased uptake of that gas by the ocean.

The resulting acidification of the ocean is occurring at different rates around the seas, but is generally decreasing the levels of calcium carbonate dissolved in seawater, thus lowering the availability of carbonate ions, which are needed for the formation by marine species of shells and skeletons.

After the tsunami in Japan in 2011, 289 species of macrofauna and macroflora were rafted to North America in just six years (Carlton and others, 2017), a very uncommon scheme, with potential long-term consequences (Murray and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAside from being a physical contaminant, plastics and microplastics often contain chemical additives, such as phthalates and brominated flame retardants (see chap. 11) and capture other contaminants.

Such innovations have led to both positive and negative outcomes for the marine environment. Some advances in fishing technologies have led to an overall increase in capacity and, in many regions in Asia, Europe and North America, to overcapacity (Eigaard and others, 2014). Increased efficiencies generated through the use of technologies (also known as “technological creep”), for example, allowing for more efficient and accurate targeting of catches, have also resulted in effort gains within fisheries, thus contributing to overfishing of stocks (Finkbeiner and others, 2017). Conversely, advances in remote sensing, camera technologies, field deployment of genetic approaches to species identification and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches are now contributing to better monitoring of illegal, unregulated and unreported catches (Detsis and others, 2012), improving the reporting of catches (Ruiz and others, 2014), allowing for the traceability of products (Lewis and Boyle, 2017) and reducing wastage along supply chains (Hafliðason and others, 2012).

Measured by adding up the total years of healthy life that are lost through disease, disability and death, the worldwide burden of disease incurred by bathing in contaminated seawater is some 400,000 disability-adjusted life-years (a standard measure of time lost owing to premature death and time spent disabled by disease), comparable to the global impacts of diphtheria and leprosy. GESAMP and WHO estimated that the cost to society, worldwide, amounted to about $1.6 billion per year (GESAMP, 2001).

Human faecal matter in water bodies constitutes the greatest public health threat because humans are reservoirs for many bacteria, parasites and viruses that are dangerous to other humans and can lead to a variety of illnesses. The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation. Drawing together the scientific work in the field, in 2003, WHO published Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments: Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003). More recently, WHO, with the support of the European Union, prepared recommendations on scientific, analytical and epidemiological developments relevant to the parameters for bathing-water quality, with special reference to Europe (WHO, 2018). WHO has indicated that the recommendations will inform the revision of the 2003 Guidelines (WHO, 2020). However, achievement of such standards requires adequate planning and infrastructure. Even where, as in some parts of India, strenuous efforts are being made to install properly operating sewage treatment systems, problems persist. For example, in Goa, a major tourist location, faecal coliform bacteria exceeded the relevant standards at all 10 of the beaches monitored (Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring of bathing water will not achieve its aim of improving public health without improvements in the communication to the public of the findings so that they are readily understandable.

Over the same period, catches of pinnipeds and other cetaceans in the northern hemisphere have remained relatively stable overall (North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), 2019; International Whaling Commission (IWC), 2019). Catches of baleen whales in the western North Pacific have remained broadly stable since the first Assessment (IWC, 2019, catches taken under special permits) and catches in Antarctic waters were suspended in 2019 (IWC, 2019). Regulated subsistence hunting of marine mammals remains stable (NAMMCO, 2019; IWC, 2019). Two intergovernmental organizations continue to provide a forum for discussions on and the assessment and management of catches of marine mammals: IWC, established in 1946, and NAMMCO, established in 1992.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBy-caught marine mammals can complement fishery catches for human consumption. This practice can be further complemented by hunting or the use of stranded animals in some countries (Robards and Reeves, 2011). Marine mammals used in such a way has been termed “aquatic wild meat” or “marine bushmeat”, the latter as an analogy with terrestrial bushmeat used to support food security in deprived regions (Cosentino and Fisher, 2016; Clapham and Van Waerebeek, 2007). The catch and consumption of coastal species in lower latitudes are likely to have increased (Robards and Reeves, 2011), in particular in South-East Asia and West Africa (Porter and Lai, 2017; Liu and others, 2019; Mintzer and others, 2018; Van Waerebeek and others, 2017), where the sustainability of such practices is often unknown. As habitat change associated with climate change redistributes species and has a potential impact on population abundances (Moore and Reeves, 2018), communities relying on the harvesting of marine mammals for food are also likely to be affected, resulting in future food security challenges (Brinkman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine mammals remain culturally significant, with objects created from body parts and as part of the imagery of coastal traditions and cultures.

Health has been defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization-Regional Office for Europe (WHO-Europe), 1984). However, people live in an interdependent existence with the totality of the living world. Hence, human health cannot be separated from the health of our total planetary biodiversity and has now been redefined as the ability of a body to adapt to new threats and infirmities (Lancet-Editorial, 2009). The complex interactions between the seas and oceans and human health and well‐ being have been viewed primarily within a risk framework, for example, the adverse impacts of extreme weather, chemical pollution (from domestic and industrial effluents, aquaculture, offshore industries, air pollutants and road dust run-off, and black carbon in the Arctic) and, increasingly, climate change (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2017, 2019; Fleming and others, 2019; Pleijel and others, 2013; Tornero and Hanke, 2016; Valotto and others, 2015; Walker and others, 2019; Winiger and others, 2019). However, new research is expanding our concept of the “health” of the “global ocean”, with a broader recognition of its essential and beneficial contribution to the current and future health and well‐being of humankind (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2019; Ercolano and others, 2019; Lindequist, 2016; see table below).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine environment contributes significantly to human health through the provision and quality of the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink and marine-derived pharmaceuticals, as well as providing health-enhancing economic and recreational opportunities (see chaps. 5 and 8A; Ercolano and others, 2019; Lindequist, 2016). The coastal environment can also have a calming effect (White and others, 2013) and provide important cultural benefits (see chap. 28, sect. 1.4). However, at the same time, the marine environment is under pressure from such human activities as transport, industrial processes, fishing, agricultural and waste management practices, climate change-related impacts associated with rising sea levels and coastal erosion, and biological invasions. The figure below summarizes the links between the degradation of the marine environment and human health.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe assessment and management of the impacts on marine ecosystems and on human health resulting from the pressures on those ecosystems have largely been undertaken separately under the umbrella of different disciplines and, frequently, with little or no obvious collaborative interaction (Depledge and others, 2013; Moore and others, 2013, 2014). Consequently, many of our perceptions of the interactions between the marine environment and human health are limited and still relatively unchallenged, leaving an opportunity to address critical knowledge gaps to further inform science-based policies for the sustainable use of marine resources and environmental and human health protection (see figure below and Moore and others, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe complex nature of the interactions between the marine environment and human health was reviewed by the European Marine Board (Moore and others, 2013, 2014) and others (Borja and others, 2020; Depledge and others, 2013, 2017, 2019; Fleming and others, 2014, 2019).

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defines an ecosystem as “a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit” and goes on to define ecosystem services as “the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems” (p. 27). This definition encompasses both the benefits people perceive and those benefits that are not perceived (van den Belt et al., 2011b). In other words, a benefit from ecosystems does not need to be explicitly perceived (or empirically quantified) to be considered relevant in an ecosystem services approach. Similarly, ecosystems and their processes and functions can be described in biophysical (and other) relationships whether or not humans benefit from them. Ecosystem services reflect the influence of these processes on society’s wellbeing; including people’s physical and mental well-being. While ecosystems provide services not only to people, the evaluations of services are, by definition anthropocentric.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe deliberate interlinking between human and natural systems is not new, but over the past few decades interest in “ecosystem services” as a concept has surged, with research and activities involving natural and social scientists, governments and businesses alike (Costanza et al., 1997; Daily, 1997; Braat and de Groot, 2012). This interest is in part driven by the growing recognition that the collective impact of humans on the earth is pushing against the biophysical limits of many ecosystems to sustain the well-being of humankind. Such pressures are well recognized (e.g., Halpern et al., 2008; Rockstrom et al., 2009) and are felt by pelagic, coastal, and intertidal ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe human system – comprising built, human and social capital –ultimately is fully dependent on natural capital. Ecosystems can exist without humans in them, but humans cannot survive without ecosystems. Therefore, the human system can usefully be considered as a sub-system of natural capital. An ecosystem services approach then becomes an organizing principle to make visible the relative contribution of natural capital toward the goal of human well-being. The use of such an organizing principle can be the basis for investments to maintain and enhance natural capital to ensure a flow of ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 2014).\u003c/p\u003e   ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2527","2","What equipment is used to measure the sea level height ?","Qual equipament é utilizado para medir a altura do nível do mar?","Which equipment can be used to measure the sea level height?","Qual equipamento pode ser utilizado para medir a altura do nível do mar?","High-precision satellite altimetry","Altimetria de satélites de alta precisão","High-precision satellite altimetry","Altimetria de satélite de alta precisão","","\u003cp\u003eOcean warming and land ice melt are the main causes of present-day accelerating global mean sea level rise. The global mean sea level has been rising since 1993 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with a clear superimposed acceleration of approximately 0.1 mm per year. Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions. Owing to global warming, many circulation systems also experience changes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in sea level height, measured with high-precision satellite altimetry, hint at the widening and strengthening of the subtropical gyres in the North and South Pacific. The studies, furthermore, show a poleward movement of many ocean currents, including the Antarctic circumpolar current and the subtropical gyres in the southern hemisphere, as well as western boundary currents in all ocean basins. One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future. Impacts that follow such changes include regional sea level rise, changes in nutrient distribution and carbon uptake and feedbacks with the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe globally averaged ocean surface temperature data show a warming of 0.62±0.12 °C per century over the period 1900– 2018.

The warming happens in most ocean regions with some areas, such as in the North Atlantic, showing long-term cooling.

Similar changes are also seen in the ocean subsurface, with similar patterns of freshening low-salinity waters and enhanced high-salinity waters represented in each of the ocean basins, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian, and across the Southern Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e \n ",false,true,1,3,5," What"],["B1995","2","What is the proportion of women among the seafarers?","Qual a proporção de mulheres entre os marinheiros?","What is the percentage of womans in seafarers?","Qual porcentagem de mulheres é marinheira?","Worldwide aproximatly two per cent of the seafarers are women","A proporção é de aproximadamente de dois por cento no contexto mundial","About two per cent.","Aproximadamente dois por cento.","","\u003ch1\u003eDistribution of ocean benefits and disbenefits\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eDevelopments in maritime transport\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll sectors of maritime transport (cargo trades, passenger and vehicle ferries and cruise ships) are growing in line with the world economy.

It seems likely that many of the major cargo-carrying operators were making a loss in 2012, as a result of overcapacity resulting from the general economic recession. On the other hand, cruise operators reported profits. According to estimates by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, owners from five countries (China, Germany, Greece, Japan and the Republic of Korea) together accounted for 53 per cent of the world tonnage in 2013.

Freshwater fluxes into the ocean include: direct runoff from continental rivers and lakes; seepage from groundwater; runoff, submarine melting and iceberg calving from the polar ice sheets; melting of sea ice; and direct precipitation that is mostly rainfall but also includes snowfall.

The changes can be observed in extended ocean time series, and the rate of change is likely to be unparalleled in at least the past 66 million years. The time of emergence of the signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites and 16 to 41 years for coastal sites, making it necessary to commit to long-term observational records, especially in the coastal zone, where most commercially and culturally important marine resources reside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOceanic oxygen levels have declined in recent decades, with strong regional variations. While the overall oxygen content has decreased by about 2 per cent in five decades, oxygen in coastal areas or near oxygen minimum zones shows larger variations. Coastal changes are mostly fuelled by riverine run-off, and the open ocean changes are likely related to a combination of changes in ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Temperature-driven solubility decrease is responsible for most near-surface oxygen loss, while other processes have to be accountable for deep-ocean oxygen loss. A further decrease in oxygen in and near oxygen minimum zones can lead to climate feedback through consequent greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice covers 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation.

Shipwrecks can also yield valuable information about the sociocultural, historical, economic and political contexts on various scales of reference (local, regional or global) between the date of the vessel’s construction (e.g., hull design, rig, materials used or purpose) and the reason for its eventual demise in the sea (e.g., warfare, piracy, privateering, intentional abandonment or natural weather events) (Gould, 1983).

The ocean has also been an important source of inspiration to artists, composers and writers, often reflecting economically important aspects of society. Some studies reveal the deep emotional attachment of people to the marine environment (e.g., the Black Sea in Fletcher and others (2014) and the North Sea in Gee and Burkhard (2010)), as well as the importance of maintaining that relationship to preserve both nature and culture (Fletcher and others, 2014). However, despite progress to date, marine research and management have until recently largely neglected the critically important role of the sense of place, including how it influences the success and efficacy of management interventions (Van Putten and others, 2018; Hernandez and others, 2007).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOpportunities for income generation and employment opportunities, for education and recreation and for scientific and artistic information and inspiration are also part of the wider range of social benefits that marine and coastal ecosystems provide and upon which the well-being of populations, regardless of their distance from the shore, hinges directly and indirectly.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,4," What"],["B2459","2","How is ocean circulation involved with climate change?","Como a circulação oceânica está relacionada com as mudanças climáticas ?\n","In what way is the ocean circulation involved with climate change?","De que forma a circulação oceânica \nestá relacionada com as mudanças climáticas ?","By transporting heat, carbon and oxigen","Pelo transporte de calor, carbono e oxigênio","It regulates the Earth’s climate and influences marine life by transporting heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients.

The main drivers of ocean circulation are surface winds and density gradients (determined by ocean temperature and salinity), and any changes in those drivers can induce changes to ocean circulation.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSea temperature and ocean heat content.\u003c/b\u003e The rapid warming of the global ocean over the past few decades has affected the weather, climate, ecosystems, human society and economies (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019). More heat in the ocean is manifested in many ways, including an increasing interior ocean temperature (Cheng and others, 2019b), a rising sea level caused by thermal expansion, melting ice sheets, an intensified hydrological cycle, changing atmospheric and oceanic circulations and stronger tropical cyclones with heavier rainfall (Trenberth and others, 2018).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSalinity.\u003c/b\u003e With the advent of improved observational salinity products, more attention has been paid to ocean salinity in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports (fourth report, Bindoff and others, 2007; and fifth report, Rhein and others, 2013) and in the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017). Changes to ocean salinity are important given that the global ocean covers 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface and contains 97 per cent of the Earth’s free water (Durack, 2015). Any global water changes will be expressed in the changing patterns of ocean salinity, a water cycle marker of the largest reservoir of the climate system.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eOcean acidification.\u003c/b\u003e Rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere also have a direct effect on the chemistry of the ocean through the absorption of CO2. The ocean absorbed roughly 30 per cent of all CO2 emissions in the period from 1870 to 2015 (Le Quéré and others, 2016; Gruber and others, 2019), and the increased CO2 level in the water lowers its pH through the formation of carbonic acid.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eDissolved oxygen.\u003c/b\u003e Variations in oceanic oxygen have a profound impact on marine life, from nutrient cycling to pelagic fish habitat boundaries (e.g., Worm and others, 2005; Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Stramma and others, 2012; Levin, 2018) and can influence climate change through emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas (e.g., Voss and others, 2013).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSea ice.\u003c/b\u003e Sea ice in the polar regions covers about 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects the global climate system through its influence on global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation. In addition, sea ice has a high albedo, reflecting more sunlight than the liquid ocean, and its melt releases fresh water, which slows the global ocean conveyor belt (the constantly moving system of deep-ocean circulation driven by temperature and salinity).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe present chapter, using those indicators, contains details of the impacts of climate change on the physical and chemical state of the ocean and its evolution and spatial patterns.

As a result of changes in the heating of different parts of the ocean, patterns of variation in heat distribution across the ocean (such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation) are also changing. Those changes in patterns result in significant changes in weather patterns on land. Water masses are also moving differently in areas over continental shelves, with consequent effects on the distribution of species. There is evidence that the global circulation through the open ocean may also be changing, which might lead, over time, to reductions in the transfer of heat from the equatorial regions to the poles and into the ocean depths.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eStorms and other extreme weather events\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasing seawater temperatures provide more energy for storms that develop at sea. The scientific consensus is that this will lead to fewer but more intense tropical cyclones globally. Evidence exists that the observed expansion of the tropics since approximately 1979 is accompanied by a pronounced poleward migration of the latitude at which the maximum intensities of storms occur. This will certainly affect coastal areas that have not been exposed previously to the dangers caused by tropical cyclones.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eUltraviolet radiation and the ozone layer\u003ch2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the sun in the UV-B range (280-315 nanometres wavelength) has a wide range of potentially harmful effects, including the inhibition of primary production by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and function of plankton communities and alterations of the nitrogen cycle. The ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere blocks most UV-B from reaching the ocean’s surface. Consequently, stratospheric ozone depletion since the 1970s has been a concern. International action (under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) to address that depletion has been taken, and the situation appears to have stabilized, although with some variation from year to year. Given those developments and the variations in the water depths to which UV-B penetrates, a consensus on the magnitude of the ozone-depletion effect on net primary production and nutrient cycling has yet to be reached. There is, however, a potential effect of ultraviolet on nanoparticles.\u003c/p\u003e  ",true,false,1,2,5," What"],["B2302","2","Why is the magnitude of the effects of oceanic oxygen decline uncertain?","Por que a magnitude dos efeitos do declínio de oxigênio oceânico é incerta?","What effects of oxygen depletion in the ocean can affect species?\n","Quais os efeitos na redução de oxigênio no oceano podem afetar as espécies?","Because the magnitude of the effects varies between species and biological and ecological processes.","Porque a magnitude dos efeitos varia entre espécies e processos biológicos e ecológicos.","Some effects of oxygen decline are dependent on direct exposure within low-oxygen waters.","Alguns efeitos do declínio do oxigênio dependem da exposição direta em águas com baixo teor de oxigênio,","","\u003ch1\u003ePressures from changes in ocean chemistry\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the oxygen content of water declines, an increasing fraction of production is diverted to microbes (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Wright and others, 2012). Food webs change because of altered encounter rates and the species-specific effects of low oxygen on the feeding efficiencies of predators and escape behaviours of prey. Energy transfer to tolerant animals, such as gelatinous species, can increase (Keister and Tuttle, 2013). The roles of vision (McCormick and Levin, 2017) and carnivory (Sperling and others, 2016) can decline within low oxygen areas because those activities are energy intensive. In contrast, predation can intensify above low oxygen zones as visual feeders are forced into shallower waters with higher light levels (Koslow and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDeclining ocean oxygen is expected to negatively affect a wide range of biological and ecological processes. The magnitude of the effects will vary among species and processes, however, and whether the magnitude of responses will be directly proportional to the magnitude of oxygen decline is uncertain. Some effects of oxygen decline are dependent on direct exposure within low-oxygen waters, while others involve the movement of organisms and material (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, greenhouse gases) among locations that vary in oxygen content, and still other effects are primarily dependent on oxygen levels at particular locations that are critical for a species or life stage. Many responses involve threshold oxygen levels at which biological functions can no longer be maintained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biomass and diversity of eukaryotic organisms tend to decline and species composition changes as oxygen declines (Gallo and Levin, 2016). As low-oxygen waters expand, tolerant species can expand their depth range, while ranges of species that are more sensitive contract (Sato and others, 2017). The relative abundance of species within systems reflects variation in species’ tolerances to low oxygen and other co-stressors (Koslow and others, 2018). Organisms, including crustaceans and fish adapted to low-oxygen environments, can reach very high densities in low-oxygen areas (Pineda and others, 2016; Gallo and others, 2019). However, in naturally low-oxygen habitats, such as oxygen minimum zones, even very small changes (representing less than 1  per  cent of the oxygen content of well-oxygenated surface waters) can result in the exclusion of species that would otherwise be abundant (Wishner and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,false,3,3,3," Why"],["B2057","2","How many kilometers of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are subject to oil and gas leases?","Quantos quilômetros da Zona Econômica Exclusive (ZEE) da Austrália estão sujeitos a arrendamentos de petróleo e gás?","How extend are Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) oil and gas leases?","Qual a extensão dos arrendamentos de petróleo e gás da Zona Econômica Exclusive (ZEE) da Austrália?\n","More than 620,000 square kilometers (almost 9%) of Australia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are subject to oil and gas leases.

In the United States, about 550,000 km² of the whole EEZ is subject to current oil and gas leases, including 470,000 km² in the Gulf of Mexico, representing 66 per cent of the EEZ of the United States in that area.

Diamonds are also an important mining target. Aggregates (sand, coral, gravel and seashells) are also important: the United Kingdom, the world’s largest producer of marine aggregates, currently extracts approximately 20 million tons of marine aggregate per year, meeting around 20 per cent of its demand. Those activities are all concentrated in coastal waters, where other demands for space are high. Deep-water deposits that have generated continuing interest, but are not currently mined, include ferromanganese nodules and crusts, polymetallic sulphides, phosphorites, and methane hydrates.

This proportion is steadily increasing. Consequently, there are growing demands for land in the coastal zone. Land reclamation has therefore been taking place on a large scale in many countries, particularly by reclaiming salt marshes, intertidal flats and mangroves. At the same time, where coastal land is threatened by erosion, large stretches of natural coastline have been replaced by “armoured”, artificial coastal structures. Those can significantly affect coastal currents and the ability of marine biotas to use the coast as part of their habitat. Tourist developments have also significantly increased the lengths of artificial coastline. Changes in river management, such as the construction of dams, and the building of coastal infrastructures, such as ports, can significantly change the sedimentation pattern along coasts. Such changes can increase coastal erosion and promote other coastal changes, sometimes with the effect that coastal land is lost for its current use, producing demands for replacement space.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,4," Why"],["B2055","2","The increase in human-occupied and modified coasts presents a risk of disturbance to which organisms?","O aumento de costas ocupadas e modificadas pelo homem apresenta um risco de distúrbio para quais organismos?","Which organisms are at risk due to increased human occupation in the coastal region?","Quais organismos estão em risco devido ao aumento da ocupação humana na região costeira?","With the increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified coastlines, there is a high risk of ecological disturbance to organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nursery purposes, which also reduces the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone.","Com o aumento da proliferação de costas ocupadas e modificadas pelo homem, há um alto risco de distúrbios ecológicos para organismos que utilizam exclusivamente a zona costeira para nidificação ou viveiros, o qual também reduz a bioprodutividade geral da zona costeira.","There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries.","Há um alto risco de distúrbios para os organismos que utilizam a zona costeira para colocar seus ninhos ou viveiros.","","\u003ch1\u003eChanges in impact\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCoastal erosion and changes in sedimentation pose severe risks to coastal infrastructure, property, economic activities and ecological systems, and adaptation calls for significant investment. There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018).

Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density.

Depth-averaged ocean-temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive (that is, they show warming) over most of the globe. The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic. Zonally averaged upper-ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths.

Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments.

These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",false,true,3,3,3," What"],["B2068","2","Why is seafood essential for food security?","Por que os frutos do mar são essenciais para a segurança alimentar?","How does seafood contribute to food security?","De que forma os frutos do mar contribuem para a segurança alimentar?

The most commonly valued services are tourism and recreation, as well as storm protection (Mehvar and others, 2018). Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries. Fishes and other seafood are a major source of food, protein and micronutrients for many vulnerable communities. It is estimated that, in 2016, 59.6 million people were employed in the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture, with a great majority in low-income countries (although that figure includes some inland activities). With the addition of those who work in associated processing, marketing, distribution and supply industries, it is estimated that fisheries and aquaculture support nearly 250 million livelihoods (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits from marine and coastal ecosystems can be categorized in several ways. Traditionally, they have been understood in terms of goods (i.e., products, resources and harvests from nature with a market value), services (i.e., processes that sustain all forms of life but do not have a market value) and cultural benefits (i.e., spiritual and religious heritage, with no explicit market value). While goods have a direct use (consumptive) value, determined through market prices, services and cultural benefits have an indirect use (non-consumptive) value that can be determined through the application of a variety of valuation techniques (see figure).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch1\u003eProvisioning services of marine and coastal ecosystems\u003c/h1\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean provides a multitude of direct and indirect benefits of value to humans. The most direct benefit that marine and coastal ecosystems provide is through their primary productivity and the resulting products, such as fishes, plants, animals, fuel, timber (e.g., mangroves), biochemicals, natural medicines, pharmaceuticals, raw materials (sand and corals) and, to a lesser extent, fresh water and fibre. In 2016, 79.3 million tons of marine fishes2 were caught, and 28.7 million tons of marine aquaculture species were farmed, supplying together an average of 14.6 kg of seafood per person on earth (FAO, 2018). Seafood is essential for food security: it provides more than 20 per cent of the average per capita animal protein intake for 3 billion people, and more than 50 per cent in some developing countries (FAO, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,2,5,4," Why"],["B2241","2","What was the effective of the MARPOL requirements?","Qual foi a eficácia dos requisitos da MARPOL?","What was the result of the requirements demanded by MARPOL?","Qual foi o resultado dos requisitos exigidos pele MARPOL?","Reductions in oil pollution, particularly in western Europe, have improved the economic position of those affected.","As reduções na poluição por óleo, particularmente na Europa Ocidental, melhoraram a posição econômica das pessoas afetadas.\n","Reductions in oil pollution","Reduções na poluição por óleo","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eShipping\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePollution from ships takes the form of both catastrophic events (shipwrecks, collisions and groundings) and chronic pollution from regular operational discharges. Good progress has been made over the past 40 years in reducing both. There have been large increases in the global tonnage of cargo carried by sea and in the distances over which those cargoes are carried. There have also been steady increases in the number of passengers carried on cruise ships and ferries. In spite of this, the absolute number of ship losses has steadily decreased. Between 2002 and 2013, the number of losses of ships of over 1,000 gross tonnage thus dropped by 45 per cent to 94. This is largely due to efforts under the three main international maritime safety conventions: the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea,87 dealing with ship construction and navigation, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, 88 dealing with crew, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePollution from oil has been the most significant type of marine pollution from ships. The number of spills exceeding 7 tons has dropped steadily, in spite of the growth in the quantity carried and the length of voyages, from over 100 spills in 1974 to under five in 2012. The total quantity of oil released in those spills has also been reduced by an even greater factor. Progress has also been made in improving response capabilities, though much remains to be done, especially as coastal States have to bear the capital cost of acquiring the necessary equipment. Reductions in oil pollution have resulted from more effective enforcement of the MARPOL requirements, particularly in western Europe. The changes in arrangements for reparation for any damage caused by oil pollution from ships have improved the economic position of those affected.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of all that progress, oil discharges from ships remain an environmental problem, for example, around the southern tip of Africa and in the North-West Atlantic. Off the coast of Argentina, however, a solution to the impact of those discharges on penguin colonies seems to have been found by rerouting coastal shipping. The likely opening of shipping routes through the Arctic between the Atlantic and the Pacific risks introducing that form of pollution into a sea area where response infrastructure is lacking, oil recovery in freezing conditions is difficult and the icy water temperature inhibits the microbial breakdown of the oil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePollution from cargoes of hazardous and noxious substances appears to be a much smaller problem, even though there are clearly problems with misdescriptions of the contents of containers.

Based on figures from 2011, the economic costs of marine plastic, in relation to marine natural capital, are conservatively conjectured to be between $3,300 and $33,000 per ton per year (Beaumont and others, 2019). While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019). More recently (McIlgorm and others, 2020), a ninefold increase in the direct economic costs of marine litter was found from 2009 to 2015, reaching $10.8 billion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to indirect impacts (i.e., on biodiversity and ecosystems), beach litter is perhaps the most visible direct impact and affects the patrimonial value of coastal areas that can be translated as the financial expenditure of cleaning up (UNEP, 2019). Damage and costs to marine ecosystems and services must be considered in the future despite an actual limited understanding of the detrimental impacts on the structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine litter can also result in increased costs for the shipping sector and recreational activities, including yachting (e.g., fouled motors, entangled propellers, lost output and repair costs) (Hong and others, 2017), but the damage and associated social costs extend to other sectors such as aquaculture and fisheries. The removal of 10 per cent of derelict fishing pots alone would provide estimated additional revenues of $831 million annually for the global crustacean fishery industry (Scheld and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMost microplastics in marine organisms are found in their digestive system, which people do not ordinarily consume, with the exception of shellfish and small fish that are eaten whole. Besides accidents and injuries, there is no evidence that microplastics concentrations have a negative impact on fish and shellfish health or commercial stocks (Barboza and others, 2018). Links to human health are not sufficiently addressed, and gaps in knowledge are even greater in relation to nanoplastics (\u003c 1 micron), in particular their absorption and behaviour (GESAMP, 2016; see also chap. 8) and how they may pass through biological barriers via different mechanisms (Wright and Kelly, 2017). As relevant toxicity data are absent, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that it was currently not possible to evaluate the human health risk of nanoplastics and microplastics (European Food Safety Authority Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2016). Moreover, there are indications that microplastic fibre ingestion by humans through the consumption of contaminated seafood is only a minimal contribution to the microplastic contamination of the total food basket (Catarino and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2402","2","How does the Earth’s ocean play a mojor role in the controls of the global climate?","Como o oceano da Terra desempenha um papel importante no controle do clima global?","What's the ocean's role in the global climate control?","Qual é o papel dos oceanos no controle climático global?","The ocean plays a major role in this control, particularly in the dispersal of heat from the equator towards the poles through ocean currents.","O oceano desempenha um papel importante neste controle, principalmente na dispersão do calor do equador em direção aos pólos através das correntes oceânicas.","The ocean is responsible to transfer heat from the equator regions to the poles.","O oceano é responsável por transferir calor das regiões equatoriais para os polos.","","\u003cp\u003eThe Earth’s ocean and atmosphere are parts of a single, interactive system that controls the global climate. The ocean plays a major role in this control, particularly in the dispersal of heat from the equator towards the poles through ocean currents. The heat transfer through the ocean is possible because of the larger heat-capacity of water compared with that of air: there is more heat stored in the upper 3 metres of the global ocean than in the entire atmosphere of the Earth. Put another way, the oceans hold more than 1,000 times more heat than the atmosphere. Heat transported by the major ocean currents dramatically affects regional climate: for example, Europe would be much colder than it is without the warmth brought by the Gulf Stream current. The great ocean boundary currents transport heat from the equator to the polar seas (and cold from the polar seas towards the equator), along the margins of the continents. Examples include: the Kuroshio Current in the northwest Pacific, the Humboldt (Peru) Current in the southeast Pacific, the Benguela Current in the southeast Atlantic and the Agulhas Current in the western Indian Ocean. The mightiest ocean current of all is the Circumpolar Current which flows from west to east encircling the continent of Antarctica and transporting more than 100 Sverdrups (100 million cubic meters per second) of ocean water (Rintoul and Sokolov, 2001). As well as the boundary currents, there are five major gyres of rotating currents: two in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific (in each case one north and one south of the equator) and one in the Indian Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,5," How"],["B2441","2","Which challenges will the world population growth bring to the aquaculture sector?","Quais os desafios que o crescimento da população mundial trará ao setor da aquicultura?","How important is the aquaculture sector to the world?","Qual a importância do setor da aquicultura para o mundo?","Due to the world population growth, the aquaculture sector must surpass the supply from capture fisheries, which will present challenges to the sector, the policymakers, and to the aquaculture community at large.

Although the lion’s share of production originates in Asia, opposition to aquaculture development is strongest in some developed countries (Froehlich and others, 2017), where aquaculture is still a relatively new industry competing with well-established activities. The world’s knowledge regarding the impact of climate change on aquaculture needs to be improved. Further research and investigation is necessary to improve seeds, feeds and health management. The increasing dependence of developed countries on farmed seafood imports from developing countries and insecurity regarding product environmental, social and safety credentials have sparked considerable public debate. Scientific uncertainties and conflicting information on the issues relating to seafood consumption have further confused the public. The establishment and application of third-party certification systems, covering the environmental, social and food safety concerns related to seafood, have begun to ease this situation. More research is needed to communicate the nutritional and health benefits of increased consumption of seafood. Determination of the nutritional profiles of cultured fishes and wild-caught products and quantification of the health benefits of socioeconomic improvements through aquaculture need further attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growing world population, annual supply from the aquaculture sector must surpass supply from capture fisheries and reach 62 per cent in 2030 in order to maintain current consumption levels. This presents tremendous challenges to the sector, to policymakers and to the aquaculture community at large. Improving perceptions will be instrumental in achieving this goal (Vannuccini and others, 2018). Better information and exchange thereof would help in allaying concerns, dispelling myths and resolving ambiguities. To improve public awareness of aquaculture, the industry needs a more open, broader dialogue that will increase transparency. To communicate the benefits of aquaculture more effectively, it must collaborate more with stakeholder groups viewed as credible by the public. While significant social and environmental issues are still to be addressed, it is important to put aquaculture in a wider perspective by comparing its costs and benefits with those of other animal production systems and with its potential contribution to sustainable food security, given forecasted demographic pressures. However, a holistic view, with a balanced evaluation of the risks and benefits of aquaculture, has been lacking, thus impeding the development of policies that reflect production realities (Bacher, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,3,3," None of the above"],["B2455","2","Although it is sometimes illegal, what types of mining are common practice in many countries nowadays?","Embora às vezes seja ilegal, que tipos de mineração são práticas comuns em muitos países hoje em dia?","What types of sand mining are common practice in many countries nowadays, although is sometimes ilegal?","Que tipos de mineração de areia são práticas comuns em muitos países atualmente, embora às vezes sejam consideradas ilegais?","Coastal beach and seabed sand mining.","Mineração de areia de praia costeira e fundo do mar.","Presently, coastal beach and seabed sand mining is common practice in many countries, although it is sometimes illegal.

The rapid increase in the demand for water, food, land and power has led to human interventions, such as the construction of large dams, deforestation, intensive agriculture expansion, urbanization, infrastructural construction and sand mining. Such human activities have placed those systems under immense stress, leading to large-scale and irreversible changes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (2018), globally, there are 59,071 dams with heights of more than 15 m and related reservoirs of more than 3 million m3. The largest densities of hydropower dams are found in South America, South Asia and Northern Europe. The largest dams, including those have been built, are under construction or are planned, are located in the Mekong River basin, the Amazon River basin and the Congo River basin (Kondolf and others, 2014; Warner and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of dams and reservoirs can reduce the sediment supply to the coast by different degrees (Slagel and Griggs, 2008), sometimes by more than 50 per cent (Besset and others, 2019), leading to the erosion of deltas and adjacent coasts. The reduction in sediment supply to the coasts is expected to increase greatly in the twenty-first century (Dunn and others, 2018), by 50 to 100 per cent (Kondolf and others, 2014; Besset and others, 2019). For example, in the Pearl River, China, the construction of two mega dams (Yangtan and Longtan) has reduced the fluvial sediment supply to the coast by 70  per  cent over the period 1992–2013 (Ranasinghe and others, 2019). Kondolf and others (2014) found that 140 dams had been built, were under construction or were planned for the Mekong River or its tributaries. Under a “definite future”, if 38 dams that are planned or are under construction are actually completed, the cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta would be 51 per cent; and if all dams that are planned and under construction are completed, there would be a cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta of 96 per cent. That would lead to a serious decay of mangrove systems and, as a consequence, the erosion of the coast and irreversible changes in the surrounding ecosystem. On the other hand, there are substantial efforts in States to remove large dams, such as the Elwha Dam in Washington State, United States (Warrick and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSand mined from rivers, beaches and coastal seabeds is used for land reclamation, beach nourishment and industry (Bendixen and others, 2019). That removes significant amounts of sand that would otherwise contribute to littoral transport, consequently resulting in a coastal sediment deficit (Montoi and others, 2017) and affecting the coastal morphology (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, 2016; Abam and Oba, 2018). Presently, coastal beach and seabed sand mining is common practice in many countries, although it is sometimes illegal. Sand mining, in general, is known to take place in 73 countries on five continents, although there is no reliable figure on the practice worldwide (Peduzzi, 2014; Jayappa and Deepika, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,2,5,4," What"],["B2092","2","What characterizes a masking effect?","O que caracteriza um efeito mascarado?","What do masking effects produce?","O que os efeitos mascarados produzem?","The production of a consequence over an ecosystem or a social component which is the same as if each causing pressure would be applied alone.","A produção de uma consequência para o ecossistema ou para um componente social igual àquela que seria produzida se cada pressão que causa o efeito fosse aplicada isoladamente.","The production of the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the other pressures alone.","A produção do mesmo efeito ou consequência para o ecossistema/componente soscial que ocorreria quando há exposição à uma das outras pressões sozinha.","","\u003cp\u003eThe marine environment is currently subject to a number of pressures, many of which are derived from human activities. They include climate change, the extraction of resources, pollution (from land and marine sources) and invasive species, resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease (e.g., Evans and others, 2017). The aim of ecosystem-based management is to balance human activities with environmental stewardship in order to maintain ecosystem properties, functions and services. That requires an appreciation of how and to what extent human activities and natural events interact and affect ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by such interactions (Halpern and others, 2008; Levin and others, 2009; Ban and others, 2010; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010). Those interactions are known as cumulative impacts or cumulative effects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms “cumulative impacts” and “cumulative effects” are often used interchangeably to describe how pressures affect ecosystems. The use of standardized language is key to the transfer of knowledge, assessment approaches and expertise across management boundaries and among stakeholders and organizations. A preference for the use of the term “cumulative effects” has been identified, noting that impacts are hypothesized and have been either not directly observed or attributed (Murray and others, 2015). For consistency, the term “cumulative effects” is used in the present chapter. There is as yet no universally accepted definition of cumulative effects and impacts, with definitions varying in the literature, depending on what is being assessed, and the context within which the assessment is being undertaken (e.g., Anthony, 2016; Spaling and Smit, 1993; Hegmann and others, 1999; Halpern and others, 2008; Johnson, 2016; Uthicke and others, 2016). The present chapter follows the premise that effects can be defined as a change to the environment, including its human components, while impacts represent the consequences of such change (Johnson, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four general types of cumulative effects: additive, synergistic, antagonistic (compensatory) and masking (Sonntag and others, 1987; Hegmann and others, 1999; Crain and others, 2008; Halpern and others, 2008). Additive effects are incremental additions to the pressures caused by an activity, with each increment adding to previous increments over time. Synergistic effects, also referred to as amplifying or exponential effects, magnify the consequences of individual pressures to produce a joint consequence that is greater than the additive effect. Antagonistic or compensatory effects produce a joint consequence that is less than additive. Masking effects produce essentially the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the pressures alone. Impacts that can be considered cumulative may result from a single activity that repeatedly produces a single pressure, a single activity that produces multiple pressures, multiple activities that produce a single pressure or multiple activities that produce multiple pressures over time (Foley and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,3," What"],["B2430","2","How do marine dead zones impact the economy?","Como as zonas mortas marinhas impactam a economia?","in what way the marine dead zones impact the economy?","De que forma as zonas mortas marinhas impactam na economia?","By making fishing and tourism industries less attractive","Tornando as indústrias de pesca e turismo menos atraentes","Fishmen can't sell the fishes form the marine dead zones and the tourist industry doesn't have tourists to visit the marine dead zones because the ecosystem isn't attractive","Pescadores não podem vender os peixes das zonas mortas marinhas e a indústria do turismo não tem turistas para visitar as zonas mortas marinhas porque o ecossistema não é atraente","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eEutrophication\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEutrophication resulting from excess inputs of nutrients from both agriculture and sewage causes algal blooms. Those can generate toxins that can make fish and other seafood unfit for human consumption. Algal blooms can also lead to anoxic areas (i.e. dead zones) and hypoxic zones. Such zones have serious consequences from environmental, economic and social aspects. The anoxic and hypoxic zones drive fish away and kill the benthic wildlife. Where those zones are seasonal, any regeneration that happens is usually at a lower trophic level, and the ecosystems are therefore degraded. This seriously affects the maritime economy, both for fishermen and, where tourism depends on the attractiveness of the ecosystem (for example, around coral reefs), for the tourist industry. Social consequences are then easy to see, both through the economic effects on the fishing and tourist industries and in depriving the local human populations of food.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,false,4,4,2," How"],["B2169","2","What can cause the diversity of fish in a region?","O que pode causar a diversidade de peixes numa região?","What mechanisms are drivers for fish diversity?","Quais mecanismos guiam a diversidade de peixes em uma região?","The ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance","A estabilidade e idade do ecossistema, a partição de nicho e amortecimento da dominância mediada por predadores.","Ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning, and predator-mediated dampening of dominance","Estabilidade e idade de ecossistemas, particionamento de nichos e amortecimento de dominância mediado por predador","","\u003cp\u003eThe global biomass of marine fishes is approximately four times the total biomass of all birds and mammals (Bar-On and others, 2018), and fishes constitute an important part of marine biodiversity. Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOverexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2487","2","What's the global mean size of the steric signal?","Qual é o tamanho médio global do sinal estérico?","What is the globally averaged size of the steric signal?","Qual é o tamanho médio do sinal estérico, globalmente?","4 milimeters","4 milímetros","4 mm","4 mm","","\u003cp\u003eImbalances in the freshwater cycle manifest themselves as changes in global sea level. Changes in global mean sea level are largely caused by a combination of changes in ocean heat content and exchanges of freshwater between the ocean and continents. When water is added to the ocean, global sea level adjusts, rapidly resulting in a relatively uniform spatial pattern for the seasonal ocean mass balance, as compared to the seasonal steric signal, which has very large regional amplitudes (Chambers, 2006). ‘Steric’ refers to density changes in seawater due to changes in heat content and salinity. On annual scales, the maximum exchange of freshwater from land to ocean occurs in the late Northern Hemisphere summer, and therefore the seasonal ocean mass signal is in phase with total sea level with an amplitude of about 7 mm (Chambers et al., 2004). Because most of the ocean is in the Southern Hemisphere, the seasonal maximum in the steric component occurs in the late Southern Hemisphere summer, when heat storage in the majority of the ocean peaks (Leuliette and Willis, 2011). Because globally averaged sea level variations due to heat content changes largely cancel out between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the size of the steric signal, globally averaged, is only 4 mm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobally averaged sea level has risen at 3.2 mm/yr for the past two decades (Church et al., 2011), of which about a third comes from thermal expansion. The remainder is due to fluxes of freshwater from the continents, which have increased as the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets responds to higher temperatures. Multi-decadal fluctuations in equatorial and mid-latitude winds (Merrifield et al., 2012; Moon et al., 2013) cause regional patterns in sea-level trends which are reflected in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) indices in the Pacific (Merrifield et al., 2012; Zhang and Church, 2012) and northern Australia (White et al., 2014). Interannual changes in global mean sea level relative to the observed trend are largely linked to exchanges of water with the continents due to changes in precipitation patterns associated largely with the ENSO; this includes a drop of 5 mm during 2010-11 and rapid rebound in 2012-13 (Boening et al., 2012; Fasullo et al., 2013).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2137","2"," What is the main cause of changes in sea level, ocean circulation, and decline of sea ice extent?","Qual é a principal causa de alterações no nível do mar, circulação dos oceanos e redução da extensão de gelo marinho?","What's the origin of the sea level changes, ocean circulation and sea ice extent decrease?","Qual a origem das mudanças do nível do mar, circulação dos oceanos e redução das camadas de gelo?","The warming of the oceans","O aquecimento dos oceanos","The global warming.","O aquecimento global.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eThermal expansion from a warming ocean and land ice melt are the main causes of the accelerating global rise in the mean sea level.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eGlobal warming is also affecting many circulation systems.

Seafood is essential for food security: it provides more than 20 per cent of the average per capita animal protein intake for 3 billion people, and more than 50 per cent in some developing countries (FAO, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,4,5," How"],["B2510","2","What integrated modeling frameworks enable the identification of sustainable ocean use?","Quais estruturas de modelagem integradas permitem a identificação de uso sustentável do oceano?","How integrated modeling frameworks enable the identification of sustainable ocean use?","Como estruturas de modelagem integradas permitem a identificação de uso sustentável do oceano?","Changes in people and economies, governance structures and the effects of climate change on maritime industries and the environment.","Mudanças nas pessoas e economias, estruturas de governança e os efeitos das mudanças climáticas nas indústrias marítimas e no meio ambiente.","Modeling frameworks that enable the exploration of multiple scenarios, including changes to people and economies, governance structures, and the effects of climate change on maritime industries.","Estruturas de modelagem que permitem a exploração de vários cenários, incluindo mudanças nas pessoas e nas economias, estruturas de governança e os efeitos das mudanças climáticas nas indústrias marítimas.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eDrivers that have the greatest influence on the marine environment and its sustainability are: (a) population growth and demographic changes; (b) economic activity; (c)  technological advances; (d) changing governance structures and geopolitical instability; and (e) climate change.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eRelationships between drivers and pressures (and their impacts) are complex and dynamic, with interlinkages between drivers leading to cumulative interactions and effects of pressures.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eDrivers vary regionally as a result of global variability in population distribution and demographics, the degree of economic development, technological capacity and the uneven effects of climate change; therefore human activities and pressures vary globally.

The nutritional properties of fishes make them important to the health of consumers in developed and developing countries. Fishes are efficient converters of feed into high quality food and their carbon footprint is lower than that of other animal production systems. Fisheries and aquaculture value chains contribute substantially to the income and employment, and therefore indirectly to the food security, of more than 10 per cent of the world’s population, principally in developing countries and emerging economies (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 80 million tons of aquatic animals produced in 2016 contributed 46 per cent to total aquatic animal production and a little over 54  per  cent to total fish consumption in the same year.

Currents form natural boundaries that help define distinct habitats. Such boundaries may isolate different genetic strains of the same species as well as different species. Many marine animals (for example, salmon and squid) have migration patterns that rely upon transport in major ocean current systems, and other species rely on currents to distribute their larvae to new habitats. Populations of ocean species naturally fluctuate from year to year, and ocean currents often play a significant role. The survival of plankton, for example, is affected by where the currents carry them. Food supply varies as changing circulation and upwelling patterns lead to higher or lower nutrient concentrations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe heterogeneity of the oceans, its water masses, currents, ecological processes, geological history and seafloor morphology, have resulted in great variations in the spatial distribution of life. In short, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across the oceans: there are local and regional biodiversity “hotspots” (see Chapters 33 and 35). Figure 3 shows a way in which the diversity of species is consequently distributed around the world. Various classification systems have been devised to systematize this variety, including the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) (Davies and Moss, 1999; Connor et al., 2004) and the Global Open Ocean and Deep Sea-habitats (GOODS) classification and its refinements (Agnostini 2008; Rice et al 2011)).\u003c/p\u003e \n ",false,true,3,2,4," How"],["B2126","2","What has replaced large stretches of natural coastline?","O que tem substituído grandes extensões de costa natural?","Streches of natural coastline has been replaced by what?","Grandes extensões de costa têm sido substituídas por o que?","Artificial coastal structures.","Estruturas costeiras artificiais.","“armoured”, artificial coastal structures","estruturas costais artificiais \"blindadas\"","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreased use of ocean space\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eIncreased coastal population and urbanization (including tourism)\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eA large proportion of humans live in the coastal zone: 38 per cent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the shore, 44 per cent within 150 km, 50 per cent within 200 km, and 67 per cent within 400 km. This proportion is steadily increasing. Consequently, there are growing demands for land in the coastal zone. Land reclamation has therefore been taking place on a large scale in many countries, particularly by reclaiming salt marshes, intertidal flats and mangroves. At the same time, where coastal land is threatened by erosion, large stretches of natural coastline have been replaced by “armoured”, artificial coastal structures. Those can significantly affect coastal currents and the ability of marine biotas to use the coast as part of their habitat. Tourist developments have also significantly increased the lengths of artificial coastline. Changes in river management, such as the construction of dams, and the building of coastal infrastructures, such as ports, can significantly change the sedimentation pattern along coasts. Such changes can increase coastal erosion and promote other coastal changes, sometimes with the effect that coastal land is lost for its current use, producing demands for replacement space.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,4,5," What"],["B2538","2","How many countries are known for having sand mining in their territories ?","Quantos países são conhecidos por terem mineração de areia em seus territórios?","In how many countries is known sand mining is a common practice?","Em quantos países sabe-se que a mineração de areia é uma prática comum?","73","73","73 countries.","73 países.","","\u003ch1\u003eChanges in drivers\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eHuman civilizations originated and thrived in the floodplains and the deltaic coastal zones of the world’s large rivers, which are now inhabited by about 2.7 billion people (Best, 2019). The rapid increase in the demand for water, food, land and power has led to human interventions, such as the construction of large dams, deforestation, intensive agriculture expansion, urbanization, infrastructural construction and sand mining. Such human activities have placed those systems under immense stress, leading to large-scale and irreversible changes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the International Commission on Large Dams (2018), globally, there are 59,071 dams with heights of more than 15 m and related reservoirs of more than 3 million m3. The largest densities of hydropower dams are found in South America, South Asia and Northern Europe. The largest dams, including those have been built, are under construction or are planned, are located in the Mekong River basin, the Amazon River basin and the Congo River basin (Kondolf and others, 2014; Warner and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe construction of dams and reservoirs can reduce the sediment supply to the coast by different degrees (Slagel and Griggs, 2008), sometimes by more than 50 per cent (Besset and others, 2019), leading to the erosion of deltas and adjacent coasts. The reduction in sediment supply to the coasts is expected to increase greatly in the twenty-first century (Dunn and others, 2018), by 50 to 100 per cent (Kondolf and others, 2014; Besset and others, 2019). For example, in the Pearl River, China, the construction of two mega dams (Yangtan and Longtan) has reduced the fluvial sediment supply to the coast by 70  per  cent over the period 1992–2013 (Ranasinghe and others, 2019). Kondolf and others (2014) found that 140 dams had been built, were under construction or were planned for the Mekong River or its tributaries. Under a “definite future”, if 38 dams that are planned or are under construction are actually completed, the cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta would be 51 per cent; and if all dams that are planned and under construction are completed, there would be a cumulative sediment reduction to the Mekong Delta of 96 per cent. That would lead to a serious decay of mangrove systems and, as a consequence, the erosion of the coast and irreversible changes in the surrounding ecosystem. On the other hand, there are substantial efforts in States to remove large dams, such as the Elwha Dam in Washington State, United States (Warrick and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSand mined from rivers, beaches and coastal seabeds is used for land reclamation, beach nourishment and industry (Bendixen and others, 2019).

Presently, coastal beach and seabed sand mining is common practice in many countries, although it is sometimes illegal.

Based on figures from 2011, the economic costs of marine plastic, in relation to marine natural capital, are conservatively conjectured to be between $3,300 and $33,000 per ton per year (Beaumont and others, 2019). While the input of plastic into the ocean is limited in European coastal areas (Jambeck and others, 2015), the estimated costs of cleaning up marine litter in coastal areas can amount to up to €630 million per year (Crippa and others, 2019). More recently (McIlgorm and others, 2020), a ninefold increase in the direct economic costs of marine litter was found from 2009 to 2015, reaching $10.8 billion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to indirect impacts (i.e., on biodiversity and ecosystems), beach litter is perhaps the most visible direct impact and affects the patrimonial value of coastal areas that can be translated as the financial expenditure of cleaning up (UNEP, 2019). Damage and costs to marine ecosystems and services must be considered in the future despite an actual limited understanding of the detrimental impacts on the structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine litter can also result in increased costs for the shipping sector and recreational activities, including yachting (e.g., fouled motors, entangled propellers, lost output and repair costs) (Hong and others, 2017), but the damage and associated social costs extend to other sectors such as aquaculture and fisheries. The removal of 10 per cent of derelict fishing pots alone would provide estimated additional revenues of $831 million annually for the global crustacean fishery industry (Scheld and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMost microplastics in marine organisms are found in their digestive system, which people do not ordinarily consume, with the exception of shellfish and small fish that are eaten whole. Besides accidents and injuries, there is no evidence that microplastics concentrations have a negative impact on fish and shellfish health or commercial stocks (Barboza and others, 2018). Links to human health are not sufficiently addressed, and gaps in knowledge are even greater in relation to nanoplastics (\u003c 1 micron), in particular their absorption and behaviour (GESAMP, 2016; see also chap. 8) and how they may pass through biological barriers via different mechanisms (Wright and Kelly, 2017). As relevant toxicity data are absent, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that it was currently not possible to evaluate the human health risk of nanoplastics and microplastics (European Food Safety Authority Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain, 2016). Moreover, there are indications that microplastic fibre ingestion by humans through the consumption of contaminated seafood is only a minimal contribution to the microplastic contamination of the total food basket (Catarino and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,4,5," What"],["B2153","2","What are the consequences of plastic waste in oceans for humans?","Quais as consequências do descarte de plástico nos oceanos para os humanos?","Plastic marine litter brings what consequences for humans?","Lixo plástico marinho traz quais consequências para os humanos?","They represent a threat to human health, acting as vectors for pathogens","Eles representam uma ameaça à saúde humana, atuando como vetores de patógenos","the potential role of plastic marine litter as a vector for opportunistic human pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms","O papel potencial do lixo plástico marinho como um vetor para patógenos humanos oportunistas e microrganismos resistentes a antibióticos ","","\u003cp\u003eThere are a number of threats to human health arising from the marine environment that have now been identified:\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003col\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eIncrease in the spread of pathogens related to climate warming (e.g., Vibrio).

A small number of poisonous or venomous marine non-indigenous species represent potential threats to human health. Intensification of anthropogenic activities, coupled with rapidly increasing coastal urbanization, drive complex and fundamental changes in coastal waters, including increases in alien species. Some of the alien venomous and poisonous species have attracted the attention of scientists, managers, the media and the public for their conspicuous human health impacts. In the Mediterranean alone, 10 non-indigenous species are considered human health hazards, running the gamut from nuisance to lethal (Galil, 2018). Human health hazards of non-indigenous species are expected to worsen as a result of climate change. The poleward influx of warm water biota enables them to spread to regions as yet uncolonized;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eA further, recently identified health threat is the potential role of plastic marine litter as a vector for opportunistic human pathogens and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Barboza and others, 2018; Harrison and others, 2018; Imran and others, 2019). Various pathogenic bacteria bind, in particular and strongly, to plastic litter (for example, Vibrio cholerae and some strains of Escherichia coli). Such human pathogens can colonize plastic surfaces in stable biofilms. The scientific and medical understanding of that health threat of plastic pollution is inadequate but the threat is dealt with as a further aspect of the problem of marine litter discussed in chapter 12. A severe problem could arise in areas that are highly polluted as a result of natural disasters, climate crises or occurring epidemics, or in conflict zones (Vethaak and Leslie, 2016; Keswani and others, 2016; Galloway and others, 2017; Leonard and others, 2018a, 2018b; Moore and others, 2014).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ol\u003e ",false,true,5,3,5," What"],["B2113","2","How are MSP helping us to be more sustainable in human activities in ocean?","Como o MSP está nos ajudando a sermos mais sustentáveis nas atividades humanas nos oceanos?","What are the MSP contribution for sustainability of human activities in ocean?","Qual é a contribuição do MSP para a sustentabilidade das atividades humanas no oceano?","Defining some zoning plans or more complex management systems and guidances and legal constraining to enforce management decisions","Definindo algumas zonas ou sistemas de gerenciamento, e orientações e restrições legais para forçar decisões","MSP has contributed with zoning plans and others more complex management systems.","MSP tem contribuido com planos de zoneamento e outros sistemas de gerenciamento mais complexos.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eThe growing scale of human activities and the associated impacts on the marine environment mean that conflicts are increasingly occurring between different uses of the ocean.

Some problems are the result of pollutants (such as mercury) or pathogens (often from sewage and ballast water) discharged into the sea and taken up by plants, fish and shellfish that are harvested for human consumption (Takahashi and others, 2008). Others are the result of toxins generated by, or viruses found in, various biota in the sea and taken up by some fish and shellfish (see chaps. 10 and 11).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to WHO, mercury is one of the 10 most poisonous substances to human health (WHO, 2013). A principal form of mercury to which humans are exposed is organic methyl mercury (MeHg). The principal source of inorganic mercury in the sea is the burning of fossil fuels (see chap. 11). Such mercury is converted into MeHg by microbes in the aquatic environment, where it bioaccumulates in food webs. In humans, MeHg exposure occurs predominantly through the consumption of seafood. MeHg is a neurotoxin and is particularly harmful to fetal brain development. A large body of research has demonstrated a link between exposure to MeHg in the womb and developmental neurotoxicity (e.g., deficits in fine motor skills, language and memory) among populations that consume seafood regularly. A review of studies in 43 countries showed that pooled average biomarkers suggested an intake of MeHg that was:\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003col\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSeveral times above the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-WHO reference level for consumption in fish-consuming inhabitants of coasts and riverbanks living near small-scale gold-mining installations;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eWell over the reference level in consumers of marine mammals in Arctic regions;\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eApproaching the reference level in coastal regions in South-East Asia, the western Pacific and the Mediterranean.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ol\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the two former groups have a higher risk of neurotoxicity than the latter, the coastal regions of South-East Asia are home to very large populations.

Other experts, while recognizing the threat from MeHg, argue that it is important also to balance the benefits from fish-derived lipids with possible risks when considering fish as part of the diet of mothers and their children (Myers and others, 2015). Certain fish species have been identified as being at greater risk for MeHg exposure than others (e.g., MeHg biomagnifies in the aquatic food chain and larger predatory fish, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and certain species of tuna), so making appropriate choices in fish consumption can lead to increasing the benefits of eating seafood while decreasing the potential risk (Silbernagel and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,4,4," Why"],["B1984","2","When did the share of species of aquatic animals cultivated by global fishery production exceed that of wild species?","Quando a parcela de espécies de animais aquáticos cultivados pela produção pesqueira global ultrapassou a de espécies selvagens?","When did the share of species of sea-going creatures developed by worldwide fishery generation surpass that of wild species?","Quando a proporção de espécies de criaturas marinhas desenvolvidas pela geração mundial da pesca ultrapassou a de espécies selvagens?","2020.","2020.","2020","2020","","\u003cp\u003eThe major growth in aquatic production is expected to come from aquaculture and is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030, an increase of 37 per cent over 2016 levels.

The evaluation of global coastal change is not sufficiently mature to establish metrics for human-induced change to secular trends. However, identified hotspots of shoreline displacement, mostly associated with coastal erosion and accretion, are areas that are strongly linked to human activity, producing estimated 33-year trends exceeding 5 m per year for approximately 4 per cent of the world’s coasts (Luijendijk and others, 2018a). Compared with the knowledge of preceding conditions, substantial coastal erosion has been observed for a majority of deltas owing to a significant reduction in riverine sediment loads from 1970 to 2014 (Besset and others, 2019). Overall decreases in riverine sediment supply to the coast are expected to reduce the stability of adjacent downdrift coasts and, for parts of the coast, will reverse long-term accretive trends, which will exacerbate the demand for coastal management works and reduce the effectiveness of existing works, in particular those that act to redistribute sediment supply. Furthermore, that situation will increase the proliferation of coastal works, which have historically been developed in response to increased coastal population levels and a corresponding low tolerance for coastal change. As demonstrated by shoreline monitoring, the increased manipulation of coastal dynamics and the strict regulation of sand mining permits provide opportunities for substantial secular change to coastal trends, including both accretion and erosion (Williams and others, 2018; Bergillos and others, 2019). With sea level rise and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events owing to climate change, coastal erosion will be more serious for islands where riverine sediment does not exist.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,5,3,3," Why"],["B1973","2","Why do less developed countries find it difficult to take advantage of the benefits that the ocean can offer them?","Por que os países menos desenvolvidos têm dificuldade em aproveitar as vantagens que o oceano pode lhes oferecer?","Why do less developed countries have difficulties to take advantage of what the ocean brings them?","Por que os países menos desenvolvidos têm dificuldades em aproveitar o que o oceano pode lhes trazer?","Because less developed countries face gaps in capacity-building and resource and financial constraints.","Porque países menos desenvolvidos enfrentam lacunas de capacitação e restrições de recursos e financeiras.","Efforts by less developed countries to take advantage of what the ocean can offer them are hampered by gaps in capacity-building and resource and financial constraints.","Esforços dos países menos desenvolvidos em ter vantagens do que os oceanos podem oferecer são dificultados por problemas em geração de capacidade e recursos e restrições financeiras.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eOcean resources provide the main sources of livelihoods to millions of people across the globe, as well as a wide range of ecosystem services and benefits, including oxygen production, food provision, carbon storage, minerals, genetic resources and cultural and general life support services.

The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean circulates within these geological structures. This water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the sea water. Salinity varies according to the relativity between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Sea areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, with large amounts of freshwater coming from rivers and relatively low evaporation have low salinity – 8 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively, as compared with the global average of 35 parts per thousand (HELCOM 2010, Black Sea Commission 2008). The Red Sea, in contrast, with low riverine input and high insolation, and therefore high evaporation, has a mean surface salinity as high as 42.5 parts per thousand (Heilman et al 2009). Seawater can also be stratified into separate layers, with different salinities and different temperatures. Such stratification can lead to variations in both the oxygen content and nutrient content, with critical consequences in both cases for the biota dependent on them. A further variation is in the penetration of light. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis of inorganic carbon (mainly CO2) into the organic carbon of plants and mixotrophic species1 . Even clear water reduces the level of light that can penetrate by about 90 per cent for every 75 metres of depth. Below 200 metres depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis (Widder 2014). The upper 200 metres of the ocean are therefore where most photosynthesis takes place (the euphotic zone). Variations in light level in the water column and on the sea bed are caused by seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion. Where turbidity occurs, it can reduce the penetration of light by up to 95 per cent, and thus reduce the level of photosynthesis which can take place (Anthony 2004).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,4,4," What"],["B2119","2","What damages climate changes have been causing in kelps all over the world?","Qual o dano nas algas está sendo causado pelo aquecimento global?","What harms climate changes have been causing in kelps all over the world?","O que o aquecimento global está causando nas algas?","Changing in kelp species, where the warm-water-resistants are replacing the other ones.

Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore.

The evaluation of global coastal change is not sufficiently mature to establish metrics for human-induced change to secular trends. However, identified hotspots of shoreline displacement, mostly associated with coastal erosion and accretion, are areas that are strongly linked to human activity, producing estimated 33-year trends exceeding 5 m per year for approximately 4 per cent of the world’s coasts (Luijendijk and others, 2018a). Compared with the knowledge of preceding conditions, substantial coastal erosion has been observed for a majority of deltas owing to a significant reduction in riverine sediment loads from 1970 to 2014 (Besset and others, 2019). Overall decreases in riverine sediment supply to the coast are expected to reduce the stability of adjacent downdrift coasts and, for parts of the coast, will reverse long-term accretive trends, which will exacerbate the demand for coastal management works and reduce the effectiveness of existing works, in particular those that act to redistribute sediment supply. Furthermore, that situation will increase the proliferation of coastal works, which have historically been developed in response to increased coastal population levels and a corresponding low tolerance for coastal change. As demonstrated by shoreline monitoring, the increased manipulation of coastal dynamics and the strict regulation of sand mining permits provide opportunities for substantial secular change to coastal trends, including both accretion and erosion (Williams and others, 2018; Bergillos and others, 2019).

It contains the oil and gas deposits and minerals on and beneath the seafloor that we increasingly need to use. The submarine cables across the ocean floor carry 90 per cent of the electronic traffic on which our communications rely. Our energy supply will increasingly rely on wind, wave and tide power from the ocean. Large numbers of us take our holidays by the sea.

Demands on the ocean continue to rise: by the year 2050 it is estimated that there will be 10 billion people on Earth. So our share (or our children’s share) of the ocean will have shrunk to one-eighth of a cubic kilometre.

The slowing of efficiencies (i.e., the amount of GDP generated for the amount of energy used) is the result of a number of short-term factors, such as growth in fossil fuel-based electricity generation, and longer-term structural changes, such as a slowing transition towards less energy-intensive industries. At the same time, investment targeting energy efficiencies has been stable since 2014. Improvements in technical efficiency reduced energy-related carbon emissions by 3.5 gigatons of CO2 between 2015 and 2018 (IEA, 2019a). In addition, renewable energy production has grown as many countries shift to energy strategies that rely on it as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean energy production is part of many strategic developments and grew from 1 TWh (Terawatt hour) in 2014 to 1.2 TWh in 2018 (IEA, 2019b). Changes in energy production, including marine renewable energy and the pressures generated on the marine environment, are detailed in chapters 19 and 21.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEconomic activity associated with the extraction of marine resources also continues to grow as the global population expands. Marine and freshwater food production was a key protein provider and source of income for approximately 59.6 million people globally in 2016, an increase from 56.6 million in 2014. Although marine capture fisheries remain stable at around 80 million tons, mariculture is steadily increasing, from 26.8 million tons in 2014 to 28.7 million tons in 2016 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018). The implications for increasing marine food production demands, including overfishing, bycatch of endangered species and habitat loss or degradation by fishing and aquaculture, are described in detail in chapters 15–17.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMany countries are developing or have developed strategies for the potential growth of maritime activities, such as ocean energy, aquaculture, marine biotechnology, coastal tourism and seabed mining (i.e., growth of the blue economy). However, an important constraint on the growth of ocean economies is the current declining health of the ocean and the pressures already being placed on it (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2016), many of which are detailed in Part 5.\u003c/p\u003e    ",false,true,5,5,5," What"],["B2163","2","What are examples of geomorphic shapes that are altered by changes in sedimentation and erosion?","Quais são os exemplos de formas geomórficas que são alteradas por mudanças na sedimentação e erosão?","What are examples of geomorphic shapes that are altered by changes in erosion and sedimentation?","Quais são os exemplos de formas geomórficas que são alteradas por mudanças na erosão e sedimentação?","Coastal wetlands, mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands.","Pântanos costeiros, costas de manguezais, costas de barreira e pequenas ilhas.","Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands","Outras feições geomórficas sensíveis a mudanças nos padrões de erosão e sedimentação incluem costas de manguezais, barreiras costeiras e pequenas ilhas.","","\u003ch1\u003eChanges in impact\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCoastal erosion and changes in sedimentation pose severe risks to coastal infrastructure, property, economic activities and ecological systems, and adaptation calls for significant investment.

Without improved international policies and mobilization, plastic pollution will only worsen (Jambeck and others, 2015). It is estimated that, if current consumption patterns and waste management practices do not improve, there will be about 12 billion tons of plastic litter in landfills and the natural environment by 2050 (Geyer and others, 2017).

The spiritual significance of those marine species and places may be part of their self-identification and reflects their beliefs about the origins of their culture. That is particularly true of island cultures, which are often intimately bound to the sea. Expressions of loss of, or threats to, such cultures and identities are readily found, but the marine component is not easily separated.

Statistics are not available globally to show the scale of tourism in the coastal zone. Because of their geography, some countries with large tourism industries, such as Greece, inevitably have a very large proportion of that industry in coastal areas. Elsewhere, evidence from different regions of the world continues to show that coastal tourism remains a major component of overall tourism.

The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4). The absolute scale of tourism in different regions also varies significantly. Collectively, some of the countries in South Asia and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Pakistan) achieved a 119 per  cent increase in inbound international tourist numbers between 2011 and 2017 (although from a relatively low base), far outstripping other regions. Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019). The Middle East and North Africa has experienced relatively low growth in tourist numbers, but a substantial growth in tourist income, suggesting that the tourist industry is offering more upmarket experiences (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic tourism dominates the tourist market in most major economies (figure V), with 73 per  cent of expenditure on tourism and travel derived from domestic sources globally (World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), 2018). While it will include much tourism and travel that does not have an impact on the marine environment, coastal tourism is, as noted above, a major component of total tourism. Domestic tourism has grown generally in line with total tourism, and growth rates are estimated at over 10 per cent per year in many Asia-Pacific countries, such as China, Malaysia and the Philippines, over the period 2011–2017 (WTTC, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,3,3," What"],["B2512","2","Which substance is responsible for the acidification of the oceans?","Qual a substância responsável pela acidificação dos oceanos?","The increase in what substance is responsible for the acidification of the oceans?","O aumento de que substância é a responsável pela acidificação dos oceanos?","CO2","CO2","CO2.","CO2.","","\u003cp\u003eIn the present chapter, the current physical and chemical state of the ocean and its trends are analysed using seven key climate change indicators:\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSea level.\u003c/b\u003eSea level integrates changes occurring in the Earth’s climate system in response to unforced climate variability, as well as natural and anthropogenic influences.

More heat in the ocean is manifested in many ways, including an increasing interior ocean temperature (Cheng and others, 2019b), a rising sea level caused by thermal expansion, melting ice sheets, an intensified hydrological cycle, changing atmospheric and oceanic circulations and stronger tropical cyclones with heavier rainfall (Trenberth and others, 2018).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSalinity.\u003c/b\u003e With the advent of improved observational salinity products, more attention has been paid to ocean salinity in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports (fourth report, Bindoff and others, 2007; and fifth report, Rhein and others, 2013) and in the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017). Changes to ocean salinity are important given that the global ocean covers 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface and contains 97 per cent of the Earth’s free water (Durack, 2015). Any global water changes will be expressed in the changing patterns of ocean salinity, a water cycle marker of the largest reservoir of the climate system.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eOcean acidification.\u003c/b\u003e Rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere also have a direct effect on the chemistry of the ocean through the absorption of CO2. The ocean absorbed roughly 30 per cent of all CO2 emissions in the period from 1870 to 2015 (Le Quéré and others, 2016; Gruber and others, 2019), and the increased CO2 level in the water lowers its pH through the formation of carbonic acid.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eDissolved oxygen.\u003c/b\u003e Variations in oceanic oxygen have a profound impact on marine life, from nutrient cycling to pelagic fish habitat boundaries (e.g., Worm and others, 2005; Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Stramma and others, 2012; Levin, 2018) and can influence climate change through emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas (e.g., Voss and others, 2013).\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eSea ice.\u003c/b\u003e Sea ice in the polar regions covers about 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects the global climate system through its influence on global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation.

Little, if anything, has been published about the total global coastal population since the early 2000s.

The project uses night-time satellite data of observed light sources to identify urban areas and reallocates census count data within administrative boundaries. The resulting map (figure I) shows that the global coastal population is concentrated mostly in East, South-East and South Asia. The evidence suggests that concentration in the coastal zone is increasing as a proportion of the total global population (Merkens and others, 2016).

The number of, and populations in, such communities are unknown. It seems likely, however, that the number of such communities along the coasts of the world is high, and that official local government units often contain many more than one community. For example, in Nova Scotia, Canada, a recent assessment indicates that, while there are about 50 official municipalities, there are approximately 1,000 separate coastal communities (Charles, 2020). Accordingly, there is great diversity among coastal communities across the globe, notably in differences between the big cities noted above and rural communities, where such economic activities as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and tourism are typically prominent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the size of the community, it often plays a role in stewardship of the coast. Indeed, the role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly recognized and valued, in terms of many local initiatives in ocean conservation, around the world, that often succeed both in improving livelihoods and protecting communities (Charles, 2017; Charles and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly valued. Many coastal communities around the world and their smallscale fishers have undertaken a large number of local initiatives in ocean conservation, often with considerable success. The successes of those communities are often based on local knowledge, structures and cooperation (Charles, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability of coastal communities to the impacts of climate change is of increasing concern. It is relevant to the planning of tourism development, in particular in small island developing States with economies that are dependent on tourism, and fisheries management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that, under current trends of the increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change, the risks of erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization and cascading impacts owing to mean sea level rise and extreme weather events, among others, are projected to increase significantly throughout the present century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019). Coastal communities located in the Arctic, in low-lying (often deltaic) States, such as Bangladesh and Guyana, in paths frequented by cyclones or hurricanes and in densely populated megacities are especially vulnerable. On the other hand, there appear to be health benefits from living in the coastal zone (see chap. 8B on human health as affected by the ocean).\u003c/p\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall coastal communities are not just physically vulnerable to climate change impacts; they are also socially vulnerable, in particular in rural areas (Charles and others, 2019). Rural coastal communities are vulnerable to weather events and flooding as a result of geographic location and limited access to health care, goods, transportation and other services. Sensitivity to market fluctuations from their dependence on natural resources, and poverty, limited economic opportunities and losses of populations, create problems when trying to adapt (Armitage and Tam, 2007; Amundsen, 2015; Bennett and others, 2016; Metcalf and others, 2015; May, 2019c). Such factors strain material assets, as well as the social and moral foundations that facilitate collective problem-solving (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019a). Communities are more likely to mobilize collective resources in response to threats when people actively care about each other and the place they live (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019b; Wilkinson, 1991). That may be a function of attachment to the history, culture or environmental context of a place and/or the people in a place. Those attachments can become potential sources of resistance to change in contexts of low social diversity and slow population change, or the basis for conflict in contexts of high social diversity and fast population change (Graham and others, 2018; May, 2019b, 2019c). The combined effect of physical and social vulnerability on community capacities is particularly challenging at a time when collective action efforts for mitigation and adaptation are more important than ever (May, 2019b, 2019c).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, for our most vulnerable communities, many of which are coastal, transformative mitigation and adaptation is necessary to assuage the worst impacts of climate change. Incremental change is no longer seen as a possibility by most States: more radical action is thought to be needed to reduce the impacts of and adapt to a changing climate. Responses to threats from climate change are varied and include a mix of hard and soft coastal defences. Built infrastructure, such as sea walls or dykes, is widely used but tends to be more costly and maintenance-dependent than ecosystem-based measures, such as marshes, mangroves, reefs or seagrass (see also sect. 7.3). Having limited data inhibits estimates of the cost effectiveness of both hard and soft measures, especially across geographies and scales (Oppenheimer and others, 2019), although State-level estimates exist (see, for example, Environment Agency of the United Kingdom, 2015). The World Bank estimated that, without concrete climate and development action, over 143 million people could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Rigaud and others, 2018). To address those problems, in coastal areas, integrated coastal zone management is widely regarded as an effective approach to climate change and other drivers (Nicholls and Klein, 2005; Nicholls and others, 2007; see also chap. 27 on management approaches).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,4," How"],["B2005","2","Which ocean basins compose the most of the Southern Ocean?","Quais bases oceânicas compõe a maioria do oceano ao sul?","What are the main oceanic bases that make up the southern ocean.","Quais são as principais bases oceânicas que compõe o oceano sul.","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian","Atlântico Sul, Pacífico Sul e Índico","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian.","\nAtlântico Sul, Pacífico Sul e Índico.","","\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Ocean (defined as all ocean area south of 60°S) deserves special mention due to its role in the storage of heat (and carbon) for the entire planet. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2374","2","How are performed offshore seismic surveys?","Como são realizados os levantamentos sísmicos no mar ?","How cam be performed offshore seismic surveys?","Como pode ser realizados os levantamentos sísmicos no mar ?","Specialized vessels are equipped with a combination of air guns and other acoustic sources.

Including subsistence fishing, about 50 per cent of those engaged in that group of activities are women (FAO, 2019; World Bank and others, 2012). There have been no recent surveys of death and injuries in the fishing industry. However, the most recent survey shows that those engaged in the industry suffer much higher levels of death and injury at work than in other industries: about 18–40 times higher than the average in a range of developed countries for which statistics were available (Petursdottir and others, 2001).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eApart from subsistence fisheries, fisheries and aquaculture depend on substantive supply chains from producer to consumer. The problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging fishing industries, especially in relation to international trade of products, and disrupting the supply chains. Fishing operations have also been affected, with effort reduced by an estimated 6.5 per cent in March and April 2020. In some areas (e.g., the MediterraneanandtheBlackSea), small-scalefisheries have been halted. In the future, COVID-19- compliant practices will lead to restrictions on working practices both on the water and in post-harvest handling (FAO, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," None of the above"],["B2390","2","How many of largest cities in the world are located on estuaries?","Quantas das maiores cidades do mundo estão localizadas em estuários?","From the 32 largest cities in the world, how many are located in estuaries?","\nDas 32 maiores cidades do mundo, quantas estão localizadas em estuários?","22 of the 32 largest cities","22 das 32 maiores cidades","22.","22.","","\u003ch1\u003ePatterns of biodiversity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eBiodiversity and economic activity\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, because of the special physical features that contribute to high biodiversity, and sometimes because of the concentration of biodiversity itself, many societies and industries are most active in areas that are also biodiversity hotspots.

Statistics are not available globally to show the scale of tourism in the coastal zone. Because of their geography, some countries with large tourism industries, such as Greece, inevitably have a very large proportion of that industry in coastal areas. Elsewhere, evidence from different regions of the world continues to show that coastal tourism remains a major component of overall tourism.

The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per  cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4). The absolute scale of tourism in different regions also varies significantly. Collectively, some of the countries in South Asia and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Pakistan) achieved a 119 per  cent increase in inbound international tourist numbers between 2011 and 2017 (although from a relatively low base), far outstripping other regions. Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per  cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019). The Middle East and North Africa has experienced relatively low growth in tourist numbers, but a substantial growth in tourist income, suggesting that the tourist industry is offering more upmarket experiences (World Bank, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic tourism dominates the tourist market in most major economies (figure V), with 73 per  cent of expenditure on tourism and travel derived from domestic sources globally (World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), 2018). While it will include much tourism and travel that does not have an impact on the marine environment, coastal tourism is, as noted above, a major component of total tourism. Domestic tourism has grown generally in line with total tourism, and growth rates are estimated at over 10 per cent per year in many Asia-Pacific countries, such as China, Malaysia and the Philippines, over the period 2011–2017 (WTTC, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," How"],["B2005","2","Which ocean basins compose the most of the Southern Ocean?","Quais bases oceânicas compõe a maioria do oceano ao sul?","Most of the southern ocean is made up of which ocean basins?","A maior parte do oceano sul é composta por quais bacias oceânicas?","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian","Atlântico Sul, Pacífico Sul e Índico","South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian","Atlântico Sul, Pacífico Sul e Índico","","\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Ocean (defined as all ocean area south of 60°S) deserves special mention due to its role in the storage of heat (and carbon) for the entire planet. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2389","2","Which economic activity has the potential to have a major impact on biodiversity?","Qual atividade econômica tem potencial para causar grande impacto na biodiversidade?","Can maritime biodiversity be potentially impacted by any economic activity?","A biodiversidade marítima pode ser potencialmente impactada por alguma atividade econômica?

Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean.

Little, if anything, has been published about the total global coastal population since the early 2000s. Because of the significance of the impacts of sea level rise, studies since then have concentrated, in particular, on low-elevation coastal zones, which have a narrower scope (for example, Neumann and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eStudies in the early 2000s showed that, globally, there is a major concentration of population in the coastal zones. Figure I is based on the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population count grids for 2010 (Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), 2011). The project uses night-time satellite data of observed light sources to identify urban areas and reallocates census count data within administrative boundaries. The resulting map (figure I) shows that the global coastal population is concentrated mostly in East, South-East and South Asia. The evidence suggests that concentration in the coastal zone is increasing as a proportion of the total global population (Merkens and others, 2016). Nevertheless, access to the ocean, in particular for maritime transport, remains important for landlocked States.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eUrban areas near the coast reinforce the concentration: 40 per cent of the population within 100 km of the coast lives in 4 per cent of the land area within that distance (Small and Nicholls, 2003). Much of the concentration (about 90 per cent) is in coastal cities with populations of over 1 million. An analysis of such cities as recorded in The World’s Cities in 2018 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), 2018) is shown in table 1.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis thus shows that the main concentrations of urban coastal population are in East, South and South-East Asia, and that the most rapid rates of growth of such populations are in those regions and sub-Saharan Africa.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the other end of the scale are tens of thousands of smaller coastal communities around the world. The number of, and populations in, such communities are unknown. It seems likely, however, that the number of such communities along the coasts of the world is high, and that official local government units often contain many more than one community. For example, in Nova Scotia, Canada, a recent assessment indicates that, while there are about 50 official municipalities, there are approximately 1,000 separate coastal communities (Charles, 2020). Accordingly, there is great diversity among coastal communities across the globe, notably in differences between the big cities noted above and rural communities, where such economic activities as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and tourism are typically prominent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the size of the community, it often plays a role in stewardship of the coast. Indeed, the role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly recognized and valued, in terms of many local initiatives in ocean conservation, around the world, that often succeed both in improving livelihoods and protecting communities (Charles, 2017; Charles and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly valued. Many coastal communities around the world and their smallscale fishers have undertaken a large number of local initiatives in ocean conservation, often with considerable success. The successes of those communities are often based on local knowledge, structures and cooperation (Charles, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability of coastal communities to the impacts of climate change is of increasing concern. It is relevant to the planning of tourism development, in particular in small island developing States with economies that are dependent on tourism, and fisheries management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that, under current trends of the increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change, the risks of erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization and cascading impacts owing to mean sea level rise and extreme weather events, among others, are projected to increase significantly throughout the present century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019). Coastal communities located in the Arctic, in low-lying (often deltaic) States, such as Bangladesh and Guyana, in paths frequented by cyclones or hurricanes and in densely populated megacities are especially vulnerable. On the other hand, there appear to be health benefits from living in the coastal zone (see chap. 8B on human health as affected by the ocean).\u003c/p\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall coastal communities are not just physically vulnerable to climate change impacts; they are also socially vulnerable, in particular in rural areas (Charles and others, 2019). Rural coastal communities are vulnerable to weather events and flooding as a result of geographic location and limited access to health care, goods, transportation and other services. Sensitivity to market fluctuations from their dependence on natural resources, and poverty, limited economic opportunities and losses of populations, create problems when trying to adapt (Armitage and Tam, 2007; Amundsen, 2015; Bennett and others, 2016; Metcalf and others, 2015; May, 2019c). Such factors strain material assets, as well as the social and moral foundations that facilitate collective problem-solving (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019a). Communities are more likely to mobilize collective resources in response to threats when people actively care about each other and the place they live (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019b; Wilkinson, 1991). That may be a function of attachment to the history, culture or environmental context of a place and/or the people in a place. Those attachments can become potential sources of resistance to change in contexts of low social diversity and slow population change, or the basis for conflict in contexts of high social diversity and fast population change (Graham and others, 2018; May, 2019b, 2019c). The combined effect of physical and social vulnerability on community capacities is particularly challenging at a time when collective action efforts for mitigation and adaptation are more important than ever (May, 2019b, 2019c).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, for our most vulnerable communities, many of which are coastal, transformative mitigation and adaptation is necessary to assuage the worst impacts of climate change. Incremental change is no longer seen as a possibility by most States: more radical action is thought to be needed to reduce the impacts of and adapt to a changing climate. Responses to threats from climate change are varied and include a mix of hard and soft coastal defences. Built infrastructure, such as sea walls or dykes, is widely used but tends to be more costly and maintenance-dependent than ecosystem-based measures, such as marshes, mangroves, reefs or seagrass (see also sect. 7.3). Having limited data inhibits estimates of the cost effectiveness of both hard and soft measures, especially across geographies and scales (Oppenheimer and others, 2019), although State-level estimates exist (see, for example, Environment Agency of the United Kingdom, 2015). The World Bank estimated that, without concrete climate and development action, over 143 million people could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Rigaud and others, 2018). To address those problems, in coastal areas, integrated coastal zone management is widely regarded as an effective approach to climate change and other drivers (Nicholls and Klein, 2005; Nicholls and others, 2007; see also chap. 27 on management approaches).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2110","2","What kind of impacts does offshore oil and gas exploration have on environment?","Que tipo de impacto a exploração offshore de petróleo e gás tem no meio ambiente?","How the environment is impacted by  offshore oil and gas exploration ?\n","Como o meio ambiente é impactado pela exploração offshore de petróleo e gás?","Chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds, amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes, noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity.","Descarga de produtos químicos que surgem das atividades de perfuração, água produzida, lamas, quantidades de resíduos domésticos e sanitários tratados, ruído, perturbação do fundo do mar e perda de biodiversidade.","Operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts.","Descargas operacionais e acidentais e outros impactos ambientais.","","\u003ch1\u003eEnvironmental impacts\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOffshore oil and gas exploration and development practices have evolved significantly in terms of minimizing impacts on the surrounding environment, but operational and accidental discharges and other environmental impacts still occur. Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eProduced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels. Most of the increase is expected from offshore oil and gas production (IFP Énergies Nouvelles, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDisposal options include injection into the same formation from where the oil is produced, treating the produced water to meet a certain quality standard and then either discharging it into the environment or using treated water in oil and gas field operations. While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019).

Some advances in fishing technologies have led to an overall increase in capacity and, in many regions in Asia, Europe and North America, to overcapacity (Eigaard and others, 2014). Increased efficiencies generated through the use of technologies (also known as “technological creep”), for example, allowing for more efficient and accurate targeting of catches, have also resulted in effort gains within fisheries, thus contributing to overfishing of stocks (Finkbeiner and others, 2017). Conversely, advances in remote sensing, camera technologies, field deployment of genetic approaches to species identification and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches are now contributing to better monitoring of illegal, unregulated and unreported catches (Detsis and others, 2012), improving the reporting of catches (Ruiz and others, 2014), allowing for the traceability of products (Lewis and Boyle, 2017) and reducing wastage along supply chains (Hafliðason and others, 2012).

Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern.

Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014). The aquaculture sector should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,5,5,5," How"],["B2341","2","What are some advantages of aquaculture?","Quais são algumas das vantagens da aquicultura?","What are some of the advantages of aquaculture compared to alternative animal protein production systems?","Quais são algumas das vantagens que a aquicultura tem em comparação com sistemas alternativos de produção de proteína animal?","Less demand for feeding crops and land when compared to other alternative food production systems.","Menor demanda por rações e menor uso de terras, quando comparado a outros sistemas alternativos de produção de alimentos.","Life-cycle assessment is useful to determine environmental impacts and ensure environmentally sustainable development.

Although efforts related to intensification have resulted in decreased use of land and fresh water per unit of fish produced (FAO, 2017a), they have also led to an increase in the use of energy and feed, and in pollution, per unit of farmed fish (Hall and others, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough aquaculture has been accused of having negative environmental and social impacts (Bushmann and Fortt, 2005; Isla Molleda and others, 2016) and suffers from a biased perception on the part of the public, it has, from an ecological efficiency and environmental impact point of view, clear benefits over other forms of animal food production for human consumption. Life-cycle assessment is useful to determine environmental impacts and ensure environmentally sustainable development (Bohnes and Laurent, 2019).  Farmed finfish is similar in feed conversion efficiency to poultry and much more efficient than beef.

In order to achieve “sustainable intensification”, aquaculture must: (a) advance socioeconomic development; (b) provide safe, affordable and nutritious food; (c) increase production of fish relative to the amount of land, water, feed and energy used; and (d) minimize environmental impacts, fish diseases and escapes (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,4," What"],["B2494","2","What is produced water?","O que é água produzida?","What does produced water mean?","\nO que significa água produzida?","Water contaminated  with hydrocarbons generated by offshore production wells in the oil and gas industry.","Água contaminada com hidrocarbonetos gerada por poços de produção offshore na indústria de óleo e gás.","The water contaminated with hydrocarbons that comes up from wells, either of natural origin or through having been injected to enhance hydrocarbon recovery","A água contaminada com hidrocarbonetos que sobe de poços, seja de origem natural ou por ter sido injetada para melhorar a recuperação de hidrocarbonetos","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOffshore hydrocarbon industries\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor disasters in the offshore oil and gas industry have a global, historical recurrence of one about every 17 years.

As well as direct consumption, many small-scale fishermen sell or barter their catch. It is doubtful that much of that trade is covered by official statistics. However, studies have shown that selling or trading even a portion of their catch represents as much as one third of the total income of subsistence fishermen in some low-income countries.

Severe, prolonged or repeated bleaching can lead to the death of coral colonies. An increase of only 1°C to 2°C above the normal local seasonal maximum can induce bleaching.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defines an ecosystem as “a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit” and goes on to define ecosystem services as “the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems” (p. 27). This definition encompasses both the benefits people perceive and those benefits that are not perceived (van den Belt et al., 2011b). In other words, a benefit from ecosystems does not need to be explicitly perceived (or empirically quantified) to be considered relevant in an ecosystem services approach. Similarly, ecosystems and their processes and functions can be described in biophysical (and other) relationships whether or not humans benefit from them. Ecosystem services reflect the influence of these processes on society’s wellbeing; including people’s physical and mental well-being. While ecosystems provide services not only to people, the evaluations of services are, by definition anthropocentric.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe deliberate interlinking between human and natural systems is not new, but over the past few decades interest in “ecosystem services” as a concept has surged, with research and activities involving natural and social scientists, governments and businesses alike (Costanza et al., 1997; Daily, 1997; Braat and de Groot, 2012). This interest is in part driven by the growing recognition that the collective impact of humans on the earth is pushing against the biophysical limits of many ecosystems to sustain the well-being of humankind. Such pressures are well recognized (e.g., Halpern et al., 2008; Rockstrom et al., 2009) and are felt by pelagic, coastal, and intertidal ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe human system – comprising built, human and social capital –ultimately is fully dependent on natural capital. Ecosystems can exist without humans in them, but humans cannot survive without ecosystems. Therefore, the human system can usefully be considered as a sub-system of natural capital. An ecosystem services approach then becomes an organizing principle to make visible the relative contribution of natural capital toward the goal of human well-being. The use of such an organizing principle can be the basis for investments to maintain and enhance natural capital to ensure a flow of ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 2014).\u003c/p\u003e   ",false,true,3,5,5," Why"],["B2564","2","What are the most significant changes in East Asian countries?","Quais são as mudanças mais impactantes em países do leste asiático?","What are the most significant changes in coastal and marine infrastructure in East Asian countries?\n","Quais são as mudanças mais significativas na infraestrutura costeira e marinha nos países do Leste Asiático?","Coastal and offshore land reclamation","Recuperação de terras costais e marítimas.","Coastal and Offshore land reclamation","Recuperação de terras costeiras e offshore","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eCoastal and marine infrastructures are necessary for the use, exploitation and protection of the coastal and marine natural resources and environment for socioeconomic development.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eIn general, if well-designed and well-built, coastal infrastructure development can be ecologically as well as economically and socially sustainable, increase the resilience of coasts and lead to sustainable economic growth.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eInfrastructures can influence natural systems and their use and create pressures and conflicts or favourable conditions.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eBetween 2010 and 2020, there was an upward trend in newly developed, renovated or upgraded marine and coastal infrastructure.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eThe most significant changes are coastal and offshore land reclamation, especially in East Asian countries, for new coastal urban development, roads, coastal defence structures, port and harbour facilities and tourist facilities.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eDepending on the case, coastal and marine infrastructures may cause substantial damage or reduce damage to coastal and marine ecosystems.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eThe new coastal infrastructure development approach, known as “blue infrastructure development”, can harmonize coastal protection and development, as well as habitat and ecological protection, thereby reducing ecological damage.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003cil\u003eCoastal and marine infrastructure development in general has created new opportunities for coastal dwellers and supported sustainable socioeconomic coastal development.\u003c/il\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e ",true,true,3,5,5," What"],["B2206","2","Which marine lives can be affected by ocean acidification?","Quais vidas marinhas podem ser afetadas pela acidificação dos oceanos?","How many marine lives can ocean acidification affect?","Quantas vidas marinhas a acidificação do oceano pode afetar?","All marine lives.","Todas as vidas marinhas.","All marine life","Toda vida marinha","","\u003ch1\u003ePressures from changes in ocean chemistry\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean uptake of carbon dioxide emissions is rapidly changing seawater chemistry in a process known as ocean acidification (see chap.  5). As the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater increases, it causes the carbonate saturation state to fall below levels suitable for globally important reef-forming taxa (Albright and others, 2018). Most coral reefs (shallow and deep) are vulnerable to rising CO2 concentrations (Lam and others, 2019). Ocean acidification is causing the depth at which seawater is corrosive to carbonate to shoal, threatening deepwater coral reefs worldwide through dissolution and intensified bioerosion (Gómez and others, 2018). Ocean acidification combines with warming, rising sea level and more severe storms to reduce reef resilience on a global scale and augment reef destruction. In the Arctic, there has been a rapid expansion in the area where surface seawater is corrosive to calcareous organisms (Brodie and others, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean acidification may affect all marine life, for example, through changes in gene expression, physiology, reproduction and behaviour (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; IPCC, 2019). Between 2005 and 2009, ocean acidification jeopardized a $270 million shellfish aquaculture industry that provided 3,200 jobs per year in Washington State, United States. Billions of oysters died in hatcheries because seawater had become corrosive to larval shells (Ekstrom and others, 2015). In addition to its negative impacts on calcifying phyto- and zooplankton, acidification can lower the nutritional value of seafood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean acidification also affects ecosystem properties, functions and services. Some groups of organisms do well in acidified conditions, but many taxa do not (Agostini and others, 2018). Many algae are resilient to the levels of ocean acidification projected under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP 8.5 scenario, yet shifts in community composition greatly alter seaweed habitats (Brodie and others, 2014; Enochs and others, 2015). Increased carbon availability stimulates primary production and can increase the standing stock of kelps and seagrasses (Russell and others, 2013; Linares and others, 2015; Cornwall and others, 2017), although microalgae and turf algae dominate acidified waters in exposed conditions (Agostini and others, 2018; Connell and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch at natural marine CO2 seeps has shown that there is about a 30  per  cent decrease in macrofaunal biodiversity as average pH declines from 8.1 to 7.8 (Agostini and others, 2018; Foo and others, 2018), which is attributable to direct effects, such as increased metabolic costs of coping with hypercapnia, or indirect effects, such as increased susceptibility to predation (Sunday and others, 2017). Some corals grow well in seawater with elevated CO2 concentrations, but the habitats they form lack diversity as reefs are degraded by ocean acidification owing to chemical dissolution and enhanced bioerosion, causing a shift to less diverse ecosystems. Chapter 7D also reviews the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs. The dual effects of increased CO2 and decreased carbonate alter trophic interactions. Reductions in the abundance and size of calcareous herbivores contribute to the overgrowth of weedy turf algae and a simplification of food webs, with losses in functional diversity (Vizzini and others, 2017; Teixidó and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2301","2","How many species of macrofauna and macroflora were transported to North America as a result of the Tsunami in Japan in 2011?","Quantas espécies de macrofauna e macroflora foram transportadas para a América do Norte como consequência do Tsunami ocorrido no Japão em 2011?","In 2011, how many species of macrofauna and macroflore were transported to North America as a result of Tsunami in Japan in 2011?","Em 2011, quantas espécies de macrofaina e macroflora foram transportadas para a América do Norte como consequência do Tsunami ocorrido no Japão em 2011?","289 species","289 espécies","289 species of macrofauna and macroflora","289 espécies de macrofauna e macroflora","","\u003ch1\u003eDescription of environmental changes between 2010 and 2020\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePlastic marine litter also smothers and damages benthic organisms.

Over the same period, catches of pinnipeds and other cetaceans in the northern hemisphere have remained relatively stable overall (North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), 2019; International Whaling Commission (IWC), 2019). Catches of baleen whales in the western North Pacific have remained broadly stable since the first Assessment (IWC, 2019, catches taken under special permits) and catches in Antarctic waters were suspended in 2019 (IWC, 2019). Regulated subsistence hunting of marine mammals remains stable (NAMMCO, 2019; IWC, 2019). Two intergovernmental organizations continue to provide a forum for discussions on and the assessment and management of catches of marine mammals: IWC, established in 1946, and NAMMCO, established in 1992.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBy-caught marine mammals can complement fishery catches for human consumption. This practice can be further complemented by hunting or the use of stranded animals in some countries (Robards and Reeves, 2011). Marine mammals used in such a way has been termed “aquatic wild meat” or “marine bushmeat”, the latter as an analogy with terrestrial bushmeat used to support food security in deprived regions (Cosentino and Fisher, 2016; Clapham and Van Waerebeek, 2007). The catch and consumption of coastal species in lower latitudes are likely to have increased (Robards and Reeves, 2011), in particular in South-East Asia and West Africa (Porter and Lai, 2017; Liu and others, 2019; Mintzer and others, 2018; Van Waerebeek and others, 2017), where the sustainability of such practices is often unknown. As habitat change associated with climate change redistributes species and has a potential impact on population abundances (Moore and Reeves, 2018), communities relying on the harvesting of marine mammals for food are also likely to be affected, resulting in future food security challenges (Brinkman and others, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMarine mammals remain culturally significant, with objects created from body parts and as part of the imagery of coastal traditions and cultures.

It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eNIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,5," What"],["B2565","2","What does the “blue infrastructure development” approach mean?","O que uma abordagem \"Desenvolvimento azul de infraestrutura\" significa?","What does it mean to develop a blue infrastructure?","o que significa desenvolver uma infraestrutura azul?","It's an approach that harmonizes coastal protection and development as well as habitat and ecological protection.","É uma abordagem que harmoniza o desenvolvimento e a proteção costal bem como a proteção ecológica e de habitat.","Blue infrastructure development means the development of coastal infrastructure capable of being ecologically, economically and socially sustainable.

It is exacerbated by climate change, including extreme events, and other human-induced disturbances (Bax and others, 2003; MEA, 2005; Ojaveer and others, 2018). NIS are those species, including microbes, that have overcome a natural dispersal barrier to become established in a new biogeographical area outside their native range as an intentional or unintentional result of human-mediated activities (Carlton, 1999). Those species can then spread in the newly invaded area, either naturally or by means of additional human-mediated activities, through a wide range of invasion vectors (i.e., the physical means by which individuals are moved, including biofouling, aquaculture, trade in live specimens and canals) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Invasion pathways represent a combination of processes and opportunities that allow individuals to be moved from a source location to a recipient (non-native) one and include some elements of invasion vectors (the term “invasion pathway” has sometimes been used interchangeably with “invasion vector”) (Carlton and Ruiz, 2005; Richardson and others, 2011). Species that undergo distributional changes owing to ecosystem regime shifts or in response to climate change in their native range are not considered to be NIS, and neither are cryptogenic species (those whose native range is unknown) (Carlton, 1996). A subset of all NIS, often identified as “invasive alien species”, have significant biological, economic or human health impacts (Williamson, 1996; UNEP, 2002). Given that it is often impossible to predict which NIS will become invasive in which area and under which circumstances, the precautionary approach has been followed in the present chapter, which therefore covers all NIS from marine and estuarine systems.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eNIS are drivers of change in invaded ecosystems. They are influenced by the ecosystems that they are invading and the activities and events that have allowed them to be moved from their native range. Moreover, there is increased recognition that NIS are a critical component of multiple stressors, especially in coastal marine habitats, and that developments in the global economy and improved transportation are contributing to the spread of NIS (MEA, 2005). Marine ecosystems that are already stressed or degraded as a result of other human-caused impacts, such as overfishing, eutrophication, ocean acidification and habitat alteration, have been shown to be favourable to the establishment of NIS (Crooks and others, 2011). Thus, changes in native biodiversity (including in relation to species included in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),1 productivity (including fisheries), harmful algal blooms and ecosystem structure and function (chaps. 6, 7, 10 and 15) can all directly affect marine invasion success, including where NIS are pathogens. In addition, expected increases in artificial habitats (chap. 14) that allow fouling species to become established in otherwise unsuitable environments may facilitate the introduction and the spread of NIS, the range of which is also extended by human-mediated activities such as marine transport and shipping, aquaculture- and fishing-related movements and stocking, habitat restoration, canals and diversions, marine debris and litter (especially plastics, which do not degrade rapidly and can thus persist as a transport vector) and research activities (chap. 16) (Ruiz and others, 1997; Carlton and others, 2017; Galil and others, 2018; Therriault and others, 2018). 1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, No. 14537. NIS have the potential to affect, directly or indirectly, the biota and ecosystems that support healthy and productive human communities. Although NIS unintentionally introduced or escaped to the wild after an intentional introduction have been occasionally exploited (e.g. the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the Red Sea prawn (Penaeus pulchricaudatus), the Asian tiger shrimp (P. monodon), the blue swimming crab (Portunus segnis) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)), the longer-term impacts tend to be negative, with reduced native diversity. Impacts also extend to coastal communities, directly or indirectly, by reducing the overall productivity and resilience of marine systems that traditionally support sustainable fisheries or aquaculture (Molnar and others, 2008; Schröder and de Leaniz, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,4,5,5," What"],["B2404","2","What is the difficult to democratize technologies that are available today to help countries manage how they use and explore marine resources?","Qual é a dificuldade de democratizar as tecnologias que estão disponíveis hoje para ajudar os países a gerenciar como usam e exploram os recursos marinhos?","Why is acceptance of the use of technologies to exploit marine resources sustainably not globally accepted?","Por que a aceitação do uso de tecnologias para explorar recursos marinhos de forma sustentável não é globalmente aceita?","The least developed countries still lack access to technologies that can assist with the sustainable use of marine resources.","O países menos desenvolvidos ainda não conseguem ter acesso a tecnologias que podem auxiliar no uso de recursos marinhos de maneira sustentável","Many regions, particularly where the least developed countries are located, still lack access to technologies that can help in the sustainable use of marine resources.","Muitas regiões, em particular aquelas onde estão localizados os países menos desenvolvidos, ainda não têm acesso a tecnologias que possam ajudar no uso sustentável dos recursos marinhos.","","\u003ch1\u003eTechnological advances\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAreas beyond national jurisdiction have become increasingly accessible owing to technological advancements that facilitate the exploration and exploitation of deep-sea resources, including biodiversity, minerals, oil and gas. Ensuring the sustainable development of those regions will require international cooperation in order to manage them effectively. Negotiations on a legally binding international instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction are focused on ensuring the sustainable development and conservation of those areas (see also chap. 28). The International Seabed Authority has a dual mandate of promoting the development of deep-sea minerals, while ensuring that such development is not harmful to the environment. In areas beyond national jurisdiction, appropriate planning will be required to minimize impacts on the marine environment. The uptake of technological advances for accessing and utilizing marine resources, sustainably developing marine industries and effectively managing those uses is not globally even. Many regions, in particular those where the least developed countries are located, still lack access to technologies that can assist with the sustainable use of marine resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eChanging governance structures and geopolitical instability\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been an increase in nationalism and protectionism over the past decade, contributing to changing trade agreements and, more recently, the implementation of tariffs on goods between specific countries. The Democracy Index fell from 5.55 in 2014 to 5.44 in 2019, largely driven by the regional deterioration of conditions in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. When indices for individual countries are calculated, stark regional differences are evident. Countries in Scandinavia, the far north of North America and the South-West Pacific had the highest indices, while those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia had the lowest. Those differences have an impact on the implementation of global and regional treaties and agreements, thereby affecting economic growth, the transfer of technologies and the implementation of frameworks for managing ocean use, including the development of national ocean-related policies.

A number of those hotspots are located where human dependence on marine resources is greatest, such as South-East Asia and Western Africa, with substantive implications for food security compared with other regions. The Arctic is another region where the ocean is warming at 2 to 3 times above the global average (IPCC, 2018). Similarly, decreases in the pH and carbonate ion concentrations of the ocean, associated with ocean acidification, and other effects of climate change, such as deoxygenation, stratification and sea level rise, are regionally variable, with highly variable impacts on the marine environment.

Based on one-minute maximum sustained wind speed, the cyclonic disturbances are categorized into tropical depressions (≤ 17 m/s), tropical storms (18–32 m/s) and tropical cyclones (≥ 33 m/s, category 1 to category 5) (Knutson and others, 2010). A tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone, depending on geographic location.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnthropogenic climate change has increased precipitation, winds and extreme sea level events associated with a number of observed tropical cyclones. For example, studies have shown that the rainfall intensity of tropical cyclone (Hurricane) Harvey increased by at least 8 per cent (8–19 per cent) owing to climate change (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Van Oldenborgh and others, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). There is emerging evidence of a number of regional changes in tropical cyclone behaviour, such as an increase in the annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades, extremely severe tropical cyclones occurring in the Arabian Sea, cyclones making landfall in East and South-East Asia, an increase in frequency of moderately large storm surge events in the United States since 1923 and a decrease in frequency of severe tropical cyclones making landfall in eastern Australia since the late 1800s. There is low confidence that they represent detectable anthropogenic signals. Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and flooding, have increased in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean by about 1.0 cm per year and 0.8 cm per year over the period 1985–2018 (Young and Ribal, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAn increase in the average intensity of tropical cyclones, and the associated average precipitation rates, is projected for a 2°C global temperature rise, although there is low confidence in future frequency changes at the global scale (Yamada and others, 2017). Rising sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones in the future (Garner and others, 2017). Projections suggest that the proportion of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones will increase (Knutson and others, 2015; Park and others, 2017). Such changes will affect storm surge frequency and intensity, as well as coastal infrastructure and mortality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eInvestment in disaster risk reduction, flood management (ecosystem and engineered) and early warning systems decreases economic loss from tropical cyclones that occur near coasts and islands. However, such investments may be hindered by limited local capacities (e.g., ageing infrastructure and other non-climatic factors) that, for example, can lead to increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and storm surges in developing countries despite adaptation efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations affected by unprecedented storm trajectories. Management of risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity proves challenging because of the difficulties of early warning and its receptivity by affected populations.\u003c/p\u003e  ",false,true,5,5,1," Where"],["B2067","2","What are the gender issues that present themselves in both capture fisheries and aquaculture?","Quais as questões de gênero que se apresentam tanto na captura da pesca quanto na aquicultura?","What are the difficulties women face when working in fisheries and aquaculture?","Quais são as dificuldades que as mulheres enfrentam ao trabalhar com pesca e aquicultura?","A significant number of women are employed in both types of activities, either directly or in related activities along the value chain.

Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

Ensuring the sustainable development of those regions will require international cooperation in order to manage them effectively. Negotiations on a legally binding international instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction are focused on ensuring the sustainable development and conservation of those areas (see also chap. 28). The International Seabed Authority has a dual mandate of promoting the development of deep-sea minerals, while ensuring that such development is not harmful to the environment. In areas beyond national jurisdiction, appropriate planning will be required to minimize impacts on the marine environment. The uptake of technological advances for accessing and utilizing marine resources, sustainably developing marine industries and effectively managing those uses is not globally even. Many regions, in particular those where the least developed countries are located, still lack access to technologies that can assist with the sustainable use of marine resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eChanging governance structures and geopolitical instability\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been an increase in nationalism and protectionism over the past decade, contributing to changing trade agreements and, more recently, the implementation of tariffs on goods between specific countries. The Democracy Index fell from 5.55 in 2014 to 5.44 in 2019, largely driven by the regional deterioration of conditions in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. When indices for individual countries are calculated, stark regional differences are evident. Countries in Scandinavia, the far north of North America and the South-West Pacific had the highest indices, while those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia had the lowest. Those differences have an impact on the implementation of global and regional treaties and agreements, thereby affecting economic growth, the transfer of technologies and the implementation of frameworks for managing ocean use, including the development of national ocean-related policies.

A number of those hotspots are located where human dependence on marine resources is greatest, such as South-East Asia and Western Africa, with substantive implications for food security compared with other regions. The Arctic is another region where the ocean is warming at 2 to 3 times above the global average (IPCC, 2018). Similarly, decreases in the pH and carbonate ion concentrations of the ocean, associated with ocean acidification, and other effects of climate change, such as deoxygenation, stratification and sea level rise, are regionally variable, with highly variable impacts on the marine environment.

As long as the fish stock can compensate through increased productivity because the remaining individuals face less competition for access to food and therefore grow faster and produce more progeny, then fishing can be sustained.

The other main harmful inputs from that sector are drilling cuttings (contaminated with drilling muds) resulting from the drilling of exploration and production wells, “produced water” (the water contaminated with hydrocarbons that comes up from wells, either of natural origin or through having been injected to enhance hydrocarbon recovery), and various chemicals that are used and discharged offshore in the course of exploration and exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThose materials can be harmful to marine life under certain circumstances.

Without improved international policies and mobilization, plastic pollution will only worsen (Jambeck and others, 2015). It is estimated that, if current consumption patterns and waste management practices do not improve, there will be about 12 billion tons of plastic litter in landfills and the natural environment by 2050 (Geyer and others, 2017).

Based on one-minute maximum sustained wind speed, the cyclonic disturbances are categorized into tropical depressions (≤ 17 m/s), tropical storms (18–32 m/s) and tropical cyclones (≥ 33 m/s, category 1 to category 5) (Knutson and others, 2010). A tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone, depending on geographic location.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnthropogenic climate change has increased precipitation, winds and extreme sea level events associated with a number of observed tropical cyclones. For example, studies have shown that the rainfall intensity of tropical cyclone (Hurricane) Harvey increased by at least 8 per cent (8–19 per cent) owing to climate change (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Van Oldenborgh and others, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). There is emerging evidence of a number of regional changes in tropical cyclone behaviour, such as an increase in the annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades, extremely severe tropical cyclones occurring in the Arabian Sea, cyclones making landfall in East and South-East Asia, an increase in frequency of moderately large storm surge events in the United States since 1923 and a decrease in frequency of severe tropical cyclones making landfall in eastern Australia since the late 1800s. There is low confidence that they represent detectable anthropogenic signals. Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and flooding, have increased in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean by about 1.0 cm per year and 0.8 cm per year over the period 1985–2018 (Young and Ribal, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAn increase in the average intensity of tropical cyclones, and the associated average precipitation rates, is projected for a 2°C global temperature rise, although there is low confidence in future frequency changes at the global scale (Yamada and others, 2017). Rising sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones in the future (Garner and others, 2017). Projections suggest that the proportion of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones will increase (Knutson and others, 2015; Park and others, 2017). Such changes will affect storm surge frequency and intensity, as well as coastal infrastructure and mortality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eInvestment in disaster risk reduction, flood management (ecosystem and engineered) and early warning systems decreases economic loss from tropical cyclones that occur near coasts and islands. However, such investments may be hindered by limited local capacities (e.g., ageing infrastructure and other non-climatic factors) that, for example, can lead to increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and storm surges in developing countries despite adaptation efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations affected by unprecedented storm trajectories. Management of risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity proves challenging because of the difficulties of early warning and its receptivity by affected populations.\u003c/p\u003e  ",false,true,5,4,3," What"],["B2149","2","Is it possible to predict the effects of hydrological cycle changes in ocean surface currents?","É possível prever os efeitos das mudanças do ciclo hidrológico nas correntes de superfície oceânicas?","Can the effects of hydrological cycle changes in ocean surface currents be predicted?","Os efeitos das mudanças do ciclo hidrológico nas correntes de superfície oceânicas podem ser previstos?","No, ocean surface currents are forced by winds and the overall effect of climate change on winds is difficult to differentiate.","Não, as correntes de superfície oceânicas são forçadas pelos ventos e o efeito geral da mudança climática sobre os ventos é difícil de diferenciar.","Difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence.","Difíceis de se prever com grau de confiaça alto.","","\u003cp\u003eSome key alterations are anticipated in the hydrological cycle due to global warming and climate change. Changes that have been identified include shifts in the seasonal distribution and amount of precipitation, an increase in extreme precipitation events, changes in the balance between snow and rain, accelerated melting of glacial ice, and of course sea-level rise. Although a global phenomenon, it is the impact of sea-level rise along the world’s coastlines that has major societal implications. The impacts of these changes are discussed in the next Section.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eChanges in the rates of freshwater exchange between the ocean, atmosphere and continents have additional significant impacts. For example, spatial variations in the distribution of evaporation and precipitation create gradients in salinity and heat that in turn drive ocean circulation; ocean freshening also affects ecosystem structure. These aspects and their impacts are discussed in Sections 3 and 4.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother factor potentially contributing to regional changes in the hydrological cycle are changes in ocean surface currents. For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,4,3," None of the above"],["B2090","2","Why has anthropogenic noise increased in the ocean in the last half of the past century?","Por que o ruído antropogênico aumentou no oceano na última metade do século passado?","What is the reason for the increase of anthropogenic noise in the ocean in the last half of the past century?","Qual a razão do aumento de ruído antropogênico no oceano na última metade do século passado?","Commercial transport has been the major contributor to anthropogenic noise.","O transporte comercial é o que mais tem contribuído para o ruído antropogênico.","Due to the increase of commercial shipping.","Devido ao aumento do comércio marítimo.","","\u003ch1\u003eHigher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eImpacts of disturbance from noise\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnthropogenic noise in the ocean increased in the last half of the past century.

Other significant sources of noise are seismic exploration for the offshore hydrocarbon industry and sonar.

The result is changes in ecosystems occurring at various rates ranging from near zero to very rapid.

Little, if anything, has been published about the total global coastal population since the early 2000s. Because of the significance of the impacts of sea level rise, studies since then have concentrated, in particular, on low-elevation coastal zones, which have a narrower scope (for example, Neumann and others, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eStudies in the early 2000s showed that, globally, there is a major concentration of population in the coastal zones. Figure I is based on the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project population count grids for 2010 (Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP), 2011). The project uses night-time satellite data of observed light sources to identify urban areas and reallocates census count data within administrative boundaries. The resulting map (figure I) shows that the global coastal population is concentrated mostly in East, South-East and South Asia. The evidence suggests that concentration in the coastal zone is increasing as a proportion of the total global population (Merkens and others, 2016). Nevertheless, access to the ocean, in particular for maritime transport, remains important for landlocked States.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eUrban areas near the coast reinforce the concentration: 40 per cent of the population within 100 km of the coast lives in 4 per cent of the land area within that distance (Small and Nicholls, 2003). Much of the concentration (about 90 per cent) is in coastal cities with populations of over 1 million. An analysis of such cities as recorded in The World’s Cities in 2018 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), 2018) is shown in table 1.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis thus shows that the main concentrations of urban coastal population are in East, South and South-East Asia, and that the most rapid rates of growth of such populations are in those regions and sub-Saharan Africa.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the other end of the scale are tens of thousands of smaller coastal communities around the world. The number of, and populations in, such communities are unknown. It seems likely, however, that the number of such communities along the coasts of the world is high, and that official local government units often contain many more than one community. For example, in Nova Scotia, Canada, a recent assessment indicates that, while there are about 50 official municipalities, there are approximately 1,000 separate coastal communities (Charles, 2020). Accordingly, there is great diversity among coastal communities across the globe, notably in differences between the big cities noted above and rural communities, where such economic activities as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and tourism are typically prominent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the size of the community, it often plays a role in stewardship of the coast. Indeed, the role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly recognized and valued, in terms of many local initiatives in ocean conservation, around the world, that often succeed both in improving livelihoods and protecting communities (Charles, 2017; Charles and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of coastal communities in conservation is being increasingly valued. Many coastal communities around the world and their smallscale fishers have undertaken a large number of local initiatives in ocean conservation, often with considerable success. The successes of those communities are often based on local knowledge, structures and cooperation (Charles, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability of coastal communities to the impacts of climate change is of increasing concern. It is relevant to the planning of tourism development, in particular in small island developing States with economies that are dependent on tourism, and fisheries management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that, under current trends of the increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change, the risks of erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization and cascading impacts owing to mean sea level rise and extreme weather events, among others, are projected to increase significantly throughout the present century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019). Coastal communities located in the Arctic, in low-lying (often deltaic) States, such as Bangladesh and Guyana, in paths frequented by cyclones or hurricanes and in densely populated megacities are especially vulnerable. On the other hand, there appear to be health benefits from living in the coastal zone (see chap. 8B on human health as affected by the ocean).\u003c/p\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eSmall coastal communities are not just physically vulnerable to climate change impacts; they are also socially vulnerable, in particular in rural areas (Charles and others, 2019). Rural coastal communities are vulnerable to weather events and flooding as a result of geographic location and limited access to health care, goods, transportation and other services. Sensitivity to market fluctuations from their dependence on natural resources, and poverty, limited economic opportunities and losses of populations, create problems when trying to adapt (Armitage and Tam, 2007; Amundsen, 2015; Bennett and others, 2016; Metcalf and others, 2015; May, 2019c). Such factors strain material assets, as well as the social and moral foundations that facilitate collective problem-solving (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019a). Communities are more likely to mobilize collective resources in response to threats when people actively care about each other and the place they live (Amundsen, 2015; May, 2019b; Wilkinson, 1991). That may be a function of attachment to the history, culture or environmental context of a place and/or the people in a place. Those attachments can become potential sources of resistance to change in contexts of low social diversity and slow population change, or the basis for conflict in contexts of high social diversity and fast population change (Graham and others, 2018; May, 2019b, 2019c). The combined effect of physical and social vulnerability on community capacities is particularly challenging at a time when collective action efforts for mitigation and adaptation are more important than ever (May, 2019b, 2019c).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, for our most vulnerable communities, many of which are coastal, transformative mitigation and adaptation is necessary to assuage the worst impacts of climate change. Incremental change is no longer seen as a possibility by most States: more radical action is thought to be needed to reduce the impacts of and adapt to a changing climate. Responses to threats from climate change are varied and include a mix of hard and soft coastal defences. Built infrastructure, such as sea walls or dykes, is widely used but tends to be more costly and maintenance-dependent than ecosystem-based measures, such as marshes, mangroves, reefs or seagrass (see also sect. 7.3). Having limited data inhibits estimates of the cost effectiveness of both hard and soft measures, especially across geographies and scales (Oppenheimer and others, 2019), although State-level estimates exist (see, for example, Environment Agency of the United Kingdom, 2015). The World Bank estimated that, without concrete climate and development action, over 143 million people could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America (Rigaud and others, 2018). To address those problems, in coastal areas, integrated coastal zone management is widely regarded as an effective approach to climate change and other drivers (Nicholls and Klein, 2005; Nicholls and others, 2007; see also chap. 27 on management approaches).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," Why"],["B2210","2","By what means can coastal ecosystems control pests and animal populations?","Por que meios os ecossistemas costeiros ajudam no controle de pragas e no controle populacional de animais?","How can pests and animal populations be controlled?","Como se pode controlar as populações de pestes e animais?","Through trophic-dynamic relations and by supporting pollination","Através de relações trófico-dinâmicas e auxiliando em processos de polinização","Trophic-dynamic relations and supporting pollination.","Explorando relações da cadeia aliemtnar e apoinado a polinização.","","\u003ch1\u003eRegulating services of marine and coastal ecosystems\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOceans perform fundamental regulating services. They influence biologically mediated processes, such as carbon fixation and oxygen release, enabling climate mitigation and regulation. Similarly, coastal fringes perform a key role in sequestering carbon. Those services have an indirect use value for humans as they enable the maintenance of favourable and stable climate conditions (e.g., temperatures and precipitation) to which livelihood activities have adapted (e.g., crop cultivations), the preservation of human health, and infrastructure and other assets on which livelihoods depend. The role of coastal ecosystems in controlling pests and animal populations through trophic-dynamic relations and supporting pollination helps to keep at bay pests and diseases that can have an impact on cultivations, aquaculture activities and, potentially, human health.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCoastal ecosystems play an important role in the prevention of coastal erosion and can act as both shoreline stabilization and protection against storms, attenuating the strength of the waves and reducing the vulnerability of coastal settlements to sea surges and flooding events. For example, it was estimated that the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 caused greater damage to areas that had been converted to shrimp ponds and other uses than those where the mangrove had remained intact (FEnvironmental Justice Foundation, 2006) and that, overall, the thicker the mangrove fringes were, the greater the protection to economic activity that they offered (Hochard and others, 2019). Albeit to a lesser extent, coral reefs, seagrass beds and other vegetated coastal ecosystems can also have a significant impact in dissipating wave action and offering shoreline protection (Spalding and others, 2014) provided that they are in a healthy state themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch1\u003eSupporting services of marine and coastal ecosystems\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003ePhotosynthesis occurring in marine and coastal ecosystems enables the conversion of solar energy into plants and animals and the maintenance of the net primary productivity of the ecosystems. Coastal ecosystems perform a key role in maintaining biodiversity and suitable reproductive habitats and nursery grounds for aquatic species. The ecological niches and refuge for wild animals and plants that they provide directly support the provisioning services of marine and coastal ecosystems. For example, seagrass beds in the Mediterranean are estimated to contribute 30 to 40 per cent of the value of commercial fisheries landings and approximately 29 per cent of recreational fisheries expenditure (Jackson and others, 2015).

Projections of global population growth suggest an uneven but continuing increase, at a lower rate of change, to a mean population size of 9.7 billion by 2050. The decrease in the growth rate is associated with declining numbers of births and, combined with lower mortality rates and increasing longevity associated with increasing health standards, means that the average age of the global population is rising (Baxter and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of international migrants has increased from 2.8 per cent of the global population in 2000 to 3.5 per cent in 2019 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (UNDESA), 2019a). Most migrations have occurred between countries within the same region, with the exception of North America and Oceania, where, 97.5 per cent and 87.9 per cent, respectively, of international migrants were born in another region (UNDESA, 2019a).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 600 million people live in coastal regions that are less than 10 m above sea level, and nearly 2.5 billion people live within 100 km of the coast (UNDESA, 2019b).

Such growth has resulted in many economic benefits to coastal regions, including improved transportation and increased trade, tourism and food production, as well as social, recreational and cultural benefits (Clark and Johnston, 2017). However, as the population in those regions grows, it is placing ever more pressure on coastal ecosystems. The extent to which an increasing global population places pressures on the marine environment varies and depends on a variety of factors, including where and how people live, the amount that is consumed and the technologies used to produce energy, food and materials, provide transport and manage the waste produced.

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,1,5,2," What"],["B2181","2","Which groups of marine ecosystems are still difficult to document and understand?","Quais grupos de ecossistemas marinhos ainda permanecem difíceis de documentar e compreender?","","","mesopelagic fishes","peixes mesopelágicos.","Mesopelagic fishes","Peixes mesopelágicos","","\u003cul\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eThe mobilization of existing data and the development of tools and open, global repositories provide a global picture of the diversity of marine fishes, with 17,762 known species, including 238 species described since the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017e).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eWhile knowledge of the biodiversity of marine fishes exceeds that of many other marine taxa, further improvements will be necessary not only in taxonomic and biosystematic infrastructure but also in the exploration and characterization of the oceans to achieve a complete inventory.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMore than half of the known marine fish species have had their conservation status assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and approximately a third of those assessments having been conducted since the first Assessment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOf the fish species with conservation assessments, around 6 per cent of bony fishes, nearly 50 per cent of elasmobranchs, 10 per cent of chimaeras and both species of coelacanths are threatened or near threatened with extinction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCapacity for documenting and understanding marine fish diversity continues to grow, but significant gaps remain for certain ecosystem groups (e.g., mesopelagic fishes) and in predicting responses to multiple simultaneous external stressors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e",true,true,1,4,5," What"],["B2270","2","What are the adverse consequences caused by the increase in the temperature of the oceans?","Quais as consequências adversas  ocasionadas pelo aumento da temperatura dos oceanos? \n\n\n","What are the negative impacts caused by the rise of the oceans' temperature?","Quais são os impactos negativos causados pelo aumento da temperatura dos oceanos?","Rising sea level; increase in the number of extremely hot days observed on the world coast; and heat absorption of the terrestrial globe greater than its emission in space.","\nElevação do  nível do mar; aumento do número de dias extremamente quentes observados na costa mundial; e  absorção de calor do globo terrestre maior do que sua emissão no espaço","Increase in the yearly number of extremely hot days along 38 per cent of the world’s coastline.

Upper-ocean temperature (and hence its heat content) varies over multiple time scales, including seasonal, inter-annual (for example, those associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation), decadal and centennial periods. Depth-averaged ocean-temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive (that is, they show warming) over most of the globe. The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic. Zonally averaged upper-ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths.

The ocean has absorbed about 93 per cent of the combined extra heat stored by warmed air, sea, land, and melted ice between 1971 and 2010.

Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eProduced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States.

Thus, investment, along with a focus on biosecurity and health, have been on the increase worldwide (Subasinghe and others, 2019). Biosecurity in aquaculture consists of practices that minimize the risk of introducing an infectious disease and spreading it to the animals at a facility and the risk that diseased animals or infectious agents will leave a facility and spread disease to other sites and to other susceptible species. These practices also reduce stress on the animals, thus making them less susceptible to disease.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe long list of aquatic diseases and pathogens includes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, which recently devastated shrimp aquaculture in Asian countries (e.g. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand).

Revenue loss due to the disease in South-East Asia has been estimated at over $4 billion. Countries must monitor other emerging diseases, such as Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in shrimps and tilapia lake virus (Tilapia tilapinevirus), which could potentially have a severe impact on the sector if not addressed in a timely manner (FAO, 2017a). New molecular diagnostic tools are now being applied to the identification of disease agents and their distribution patterns in hatchery, farmed and wild fishes throughout the world.

Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97  per  cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap.  15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOverexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,4,5,5," What"],["B2062","2","Which regions are with higher downward trends in oil activity?","Quais regiões estão com maiores tendências de redução na atividade petrolífera?","What are the regions with an upward trend in decommissioning for oil activity?","Quais são as regiões com tendência de alta no descomissionamento para atividade petrolífera?","Mature regions, such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.","Regiões maduras, como o Mar do Norte e o Golfo do México.","North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.","Mar do Norte e Golfo do México.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSince the first World Ocean Assessment (United Nations, 2017a), the offshore oil and gas sector has continued to expand globally, in particular in deep and ultradeep waters.

In general, when smaller plankton account for most net primary production, as is typically the case in oligotrophic open-ocean waters (that is, areas where levels of nutrients are low), net primary production is lower and the microbial food web dominates energy flows and nutrient cycles. Under such conditions, the carrying capacity for currently harvestable fish stocks is lower and exports of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to the deep sea may be smaller.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, as the upper ocean warms, the geographic range of nitrogen-fixing plankton (diazotrophs) will expand. This could enhance the fixation of nitrogen by as much as 35-65 per cent by 2100. This would lead to an increase in net primary production, and therefore an increase in carbon uptake, and some species of a higher trophic level may become more productive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe balance between those two changes is unclear.

Based on one-minute maximum sustained wind speed, the cyclonic disturbances are categorized into tropical depressions (≤ 17 m/s), tropical storms (18–32 m/s) and tropical cyclones (≥ 33 m/s, category 1 to category 5) (Knutson and others, 2010). A tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon or cyclone, depending on geographic location.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAnthropogenic climate change has increased precipitation, winds and extreme sea level events associated with a number of observed tropical cyclones. For example, studies have shown that the rainfall intensity of tropical cyclone (Hurricane) Harvey increased by at least 8 per cent (8–19 per cent) owing to climate change (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Van Oldenborgh and others, 2017). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). There is emerging evidence of a number of regional changes in tropical cyclone behaviour, such as an increase in the annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades, extremely severe tropical cyclones occurring in the Arabian Sea, cyclones making landfall in East and South-East Asia, an increase in frequency of moderately large storm surge events in the United States since 1923 and a decrease in frequency of severe tropical cyclones making landfall in eastern Australia since the late 1800s. There is low confidence that they represent detectable anthropogenic signals. Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and flooding, have increased in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean by about 1.0 cm per year and 0.8 cm per year over the period 1985–2018 (Young and Ribal, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAn increase in the average intensity of tropical cyclones, and the associated average precipitation rates, is projected for a 2°C global temperature rise, although there is low confidence in future frequency changes at the global scale (Yamada and others, 2017).

Projections suggest that the proportion of category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones will increase (Knutson and others, 2015; Park and others, 2017).

The movement of species between the Pacific and the Atlantic demonstrates the scale of the potential impact.

The ocean plays a major role in this control, particularly in the dispersal of heat from the equator towards the poles through ocean currents. The heat transfer through the ocean is possible because of the larger heat-capacity of water compared with that of air: there is more heat stored in the upper 3 metres of the global ocean than in the entire atmosphere of the Earth. Put another way, the oceans hold more than 1,000 times more heat than the atmosphere. Heat transported by the major ocean currents dramatically affects regional climate: for example, Europe would be much colder than it is without the warmth brought by the Gulf Stream current. The great ocean boundary currents transport heat from the equator to the polar seas (and cold from the polar seas towards the equator), along the margins of the continents. Examples include: the Kuroshio Current in the northwest Pacific, the Humboldt (Peru) Current in the southeast Pacific, the Benguela Current in the southeast Atlantic and the Agulhas Current in the western Indian Ocean. The mightiest ocean current of all is the Circumpolar Current which flows from west to east encircling the continent of Antarctica and transporting more than 100 Sverdrups (100 million cubic meters per second) of ocean water (Rintoul and Sokolov, 2001). As well as the boundary currents, there are five major gyres of rotating currents: two in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific (in each case one north and one south of the equator) and one in the Indian Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," None of the above"],["B2340","2","What are some examples of maritime economic activities?","Quais são alguns exemplos de atividades econômicas marinhas?","What are the currently developed marine economic activities?","Quais são as atividades econômicas marinhas atualmente desenvolvidas?","Ocean energy, aquaculture, marine biotechnology, coastal tourism, and seabed mining.","Energia oceânica, aquicultura, biotecnologia marinha, turismo costeiro e mineração no fundo do mar.","Marine and freshwater food production, including overfishing, aquaculture, ocean energy, marine biotechnology, coastal tourism, and seabed mining.","A produção de alimentos marinhos e de água doce, incluindo a pesca excessiva, aquicultura, energia oceânica,  biotecnologia marinha, turismo costeiro e mineração dos fundos marinhos.","","\u003ch1\u003eEconomic activity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eEconomic growth, measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, has steadily increased globally, although it has slowed as a result of declining trade volume. Growth in the first half of 2019 stood at 1 per cent, the weakest level since 2012 (IMF, 2019). Economic growth, when averaged across the global population (with vast geographical variability in economic growth, as noted in sect. 3), has resulted in the average annual income of an individual increasing from $3,300 in 1950 to $14,574 in 2016. The slowdown in growth is largely associated with weak manufacturing and trade. In contrast, service industries such as tourism have grown (IMF, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the global population has grown and the demand for goods and services has increased, there has been an associated increase in energy consumption and resource use. Understanding the relationship between increasing economic activity and the use of natural resources is essential to identifying future sustainability and limiting impacts associated with extraction, production, consumption and waste generation (Jackson, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eTotal energy demand, as measured in million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), grew from 13,267 Mtoe in 2014 to 13,978 Mtoe in 2018. At the same time, primary energy intensity, an indicator of how much energy is used by the global economy, slowed from 1.7 per cent in 2017 to 1.2 per cent in 2019 (IEA, 2019a). The slowing of efficiencies (i.e., the amount of GDP generated for the amount of energy used) is the result of a number of short-term factors, such as growth in fossil fuel-based electricity generation, and longer-term structural changes, such as a slowing transition towards less energy-intensive industries. At the same time, investment targeting energy efficiencies has been stable since 2014. Improvements in technical efficiency reduced energy-related carbon emissions by 3.5 gigatons of CO2 between 2015 and 2018 (IEA, 2019a). In addition, renewable energy production has grown as many countries shift to energy strategies that rely on it as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean energy production is part of many strategic developments and grew from 1 TWh (Terawatt hour) in 2014 to 1.2 TWh in 2018 (IEA, 2019b).

Marine and freshwater food production was a key protein provider and source of income for approximately 59.6 million people globally in 2016, an increase from 56.6 million in 2014. Although marine capture fisheries remain stable at around 80 million tons, mariculture is steadily increasing, from 26.8 million tons in 2014 to 28.7 million tons in 2016 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018).

Sophisticated techniques now make it possible to drill multiple wells from a single drilling platform, while advances in real-time fibre-optic monitoring of the well bore is optimizing the reservoir performance and mitigating equipment failure risks (Beaubouef, 2019). Similarly, the use of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools is enhancing data analysis for detecting equipment breakdown and improving operational efficiency (Husseini, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of FPSO vessels enables drilling in areas further offshore and without ready access to a pipeline network to transport oil and gas onshore. It has also opened previously inaccessible hostile environments, in particular in the higher latitudes and in the Arctic, to exploration and development. FPSO vessels are equipped to store hydrocarbons onboard and periodically transfer their load to tankers for transportation onshore. They can also disconnect from their moorings in case of adverse weather conditions, such as cyclones and hurricanes. Once the reservoirs are depleted, an FPSO vessel can be redeployed to a new prospective site. The global market for FPSO vessels is currently boosted by large investments in deepwater exploration and development in such areas as the coast of Brazil (Rystad Energy, 2019). Meanwhile, FPSO vessel design is evolving to enhance safety, minimize complexity and reduce fabrication and operation costs (Barton, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch technological advances have enabled exploration and production at uncharted depths and distance from shore.

The adverse effects of mobile bottom-contacting fishing gear on coastal and shelf benthic communities have been documented essentially everywhere that such gear has been used. Bottom trawling has caused the destruction of a number of long-lived cold-water coral and sponge communities that are unlikely to recover before at least a century. Many reviews show that, locally, the nature of those impacts and their duration depend on the type of substrate and frequency of trawling. Those effects have been found in all the regional assessments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to fish and pelagic invertebrate communities, much effort has been devoted to teasing apart the influences of exploitation and of environmental conditions as drivers of change in fish populations and communities, but definitive answers are elusive.

Operational discharges include chemicals that arise from drilling activities, produced water, drilling muds and cuttings, as well as small amounts of treated domestic and sanitary wastes. Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eProduced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels.

Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States.

Thanks to international efforts, fishing methods have changed and the by-catch has been reduced significantly. Commercial fisheries are the most serious pressure at sea that the world’s seabirds face, although there is evidence of some reductions of by-catch in some key fisheries. Each year, incidental by-catch in longline fisheries is estimated to kill at least 160,000 albatrosses and petrels, mainly in the southern hemisphere.

Intensification of anthropogenic activities, coupled with rapidly increasing coastal urbanization, drive complex and fundamental changes in coastal waters, including increases in alien species.

In the Mediterranean alone, 10 non-indigenous species are considered human health hazards, running the gamut from nuisance to lethal (Galil, 2018).

They include climate change, the extraction of resources, pollution (from land and marine sources) and invasive species, resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease (e.g., Evans and others, 2017). The aim of ecosystem-based management is to balance human activities with environmental stewardship in order to maintain ecosystem properties, functions and services. That requires an appreciation of how and to what extent human activities and natural events interact and affect ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by such interactions (Halpern and others, 2008; Levin and others, 2009; Ban and others, 2010; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010). Those interactions are known as cumulative impacts or cumulative effects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms “cumulative impacts” and “cumulative effects” are often used interchangeably to describe how pressures affect ecosystems. The use of standardized language is key to the transfer of knowledge, assessment approaches and expertise across management boundaries and among stakeholders and organizations. A preference for the use of the term “cumulative effects” has been identified, noting that impacts are hypothesized and have been either not directly observed or attributed (Murray and others, 2015). For consistency, the term “cumulative effects” is used in the present chapter. There is as yet no universally accepted definition of cumulative effects and impacts, with definitions varying in the literature, depending on what is being assessed, and the context within which the assessment is being undertaken (e.g., Anthony, 2016; Spaling and Smit, 1993; Hegmann and others, 1999; Halpern and others, 2008; Johnson, 2016; Uthicke and others, 2016).

Additive effects are incremental additions to the pressures caused by an activity, with each increment adding to previous increments over time. Synergistic effects, also referred to as amplifying or exponential effects, magnify the consequences of individual pressures to produce a joint consequence that is greater than the additive effect. Antagonistic or compensatory effects produce a joint consequence that is less than additive. Masking effects produce essentially the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the pressures alone. Impacts that can be considered cumulative may result from a single activity that repeatedly produces a single pressure, a single activity that produces multiple pressures, multiple activities that produce a single pressure or multiple activities that produce multiple pressures over time (Foley and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,2,5,5," What"],["B2319","2","What is the rate of increase in acidity in the oceans when the pH of the global surface of the oceans declines on average by 0.1?","Qual é a taxa de aumento da acidez nos oceanos quando o pH da superfície global dos oceanos diminui em média em 0,1?","When the pH of the global ocean surface decreases on average by 0.1, what is the rate of increase of acidity in the oceans?","Quando o pH da superfície global dos oceanos diminui em média em 0,1, qual é a taxa de aumento da acidez nos oceanos?","30 per cent","30 por cento","about 30 per cent","cerca de 30%","","\u003cp\u003eGlobal surface ocean pH has declined on average by approximately 0.1 since the Industrial Revolution, an increase in acidity of about 30 per cent.

The time of emergence of the signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites and 16 to 41 years for coastal sites, making it necessary to commit to long-term observational records, especially in the coastal zone, where most commercially and culturally important marine resources reside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOceanic oxygen levels have declined in recent decades, with strong regional variations. While the overall oxygen content has decreased by about 2 per cent in five decades, oxygen in coastal areas or near oxygen minimum zones shows larger variations. Coastal changes are mostly fuelled by riverine run-off, and the open ocean changes are likely related to a combination of changes in ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Temperature-driven solubility decrease is responsible for most near-surface oxygen loss, while other processes have to be accountable for deep-ocean oxygen loss. A further decrease in oxygen in and near oxygen minimum zones can lead to climate feedback through consequent greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice covers 15 per cent of the global ocean and affects global heat balance and global thermohaline circulation. Total sea ice extent has been declining rapidly in the Arctic, but trends are insignificant in the Antarctic. Arctic sea ice extent is declining by -2.7 ± 0.4 per cent c-1 during the winter, and -2.8 ± 2.3 per cent c-1 during the summer. In contrast, trends in total Antarctic sea ice extent are insignificant, 0.6 ± 0.6 per cent c-1 during the summer and 1.1 ± 3.7 per cent c-1 during the winter. Regionally, the spatial distribution of the trends is dramatic. In the Arctic, the summer trends are most striking in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean, while, in the Antarctic, the summer trends show increases in the Weddell Sea and decreases in the West Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. The spatial distribution of the changes in sea ice is attributed to changes in wind and ocean currents related to the Arctic Oscillation in the northern hemisphere and the Southern Annular Mode and El Niño in the southern hemisphere.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2523","2","Why is the regulation of oil and gas exploration not working?","Porque a regulamentação da exploração de olho e gás não está mais funcionando?","Why is the regulation of oil and gas exploration is not working as expected?","Por que a regulação da exploração de óleo e gás não está funcionando tanto quanto esperado?

The other main harmful inputs from that sector are drilling cuttings (contaminated with drilling muds) resulting from the drilling of exploration and production wells, “produced water” (the water contaminated with hydrocarbons that comes up from wells, either of natural origin or through having been injected to enhance hydrocarbon recovery), and various chemicals that are used and discharged offshore in the course of exploration and exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThose materials can be harmful to marine life under certain circumstances.

Such regulation has been successfully introduced in a number of jurisdictions.

In many fields, however, including some forms of tourism and the general trade in fish, an imbalance remains between the developed and developing parts of the world.

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the three major southern ocean basins (South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian) and is the largest current by volume in the world. The ACC flows eastward, circling the globe in a clockwise direction as viewed from the South Pole. In addition to providing a lateral connection between the major ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), the Southern Ocean also connects the shallow and deep parts of the ocean through a mechanism known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Gordon, 1986; Schmitz, 1996, see Figures I-90 and I-91). Because of its capacity to bring deep water closer to the surface, and surface water to depths, the Southern Ocean forms an important pathway in the global transport of heat. Although there is no observational evidence at present, (WG II AR5, 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014) model studies indicate with a high degree of confidence that the Southern Ocean will become more stratified, weakening the surface-to-bottom connection that is the hallmark of present-day Southern Ocean circulation (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013). A similar change is anticipated in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas (WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), another region with this type of vertical connection between ocean levels (Wüst, 1928). These changes will result in fresher, warmer surface ocean waters in the polar and subpolar regions (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014; WG I AR5 12.7.4.3, Collins et al., 2013), significantly altering their chemistry and ecosystems.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,4,5,5," What"],["B2514","2","Why scientists are more reliant on public databases of genetic sequence data rather than physical samples?","Por que os cientistas confiam mais em bancos de dados públicos de dados de sequência genética do que em amostras físicas?","Why scientists are more reliant on public databases of genetic sequence data rather than on physical samples?","Por que os cientistas confiam mais em bancos de dados públicos de dados de sequenciamento genético do que em amostras físicas?","Decreasing sequencing and gene synthesis costs and advances in the metabolic engineering and synthetic biology fields.","Diminuição dos custos de sequenciamento e síntese de genes e avanços nas áreas de engenharia metabólica e biologia sintética.","Due to rapidly decreasing sequencing and gene synthesis costs and swift advances in the metabolic engineering and synthetic biology fields within the biotechnology sector .","Devido à rápida redução dos custos de sequenciamento e síntese de genes e avanços rápidos nas áreas de engenharia metabólica e biologia sintética no setor de biotecnologia.","","\u003cul\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eMarine genetic resources continue to be the focus of an expanding range of commercial and non-commercial applications.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eRapidly decreasing sequencing and gene synthesis costs and swift advances in the metabolic engineering and synthetic biology fields within the biotechnology sector have rendered scientists less reliant on physical samples and increasingly dependent on the exponentially expanding public databases of genetic sequence data.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eSponges and algae continue to attract substantial interest for the bioactive properties of their natural compounds.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eWithin the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, capacity-building issues persist, with entities in a handful of countries conducting the majority of research and development associated with marine genetic resources.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003cli\u003eInternational processes and agreements with relevance to marine genetic resources include the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\u003c/li\u003e \n\n\u003c/ul\u003e ",true,true,4,5,5," Why"],["B2550","2","What makes many of the people living on fishing and aquaculture vulnerable?","O que torna vulneráveis muitas das pessoas que vivem de pesca e aquicultura?","Why are people living on fishing and aquaculture vulnerable?

Exploitation inevitably reduces total population biomass through removals. As long as the fish stock can compensate through increased productivity because the remaining individuals face less competition for access to food and therefore grow faster and produce more progeny, then fishing can be sustained.

Measured by adding up the total years of healthy life that are lost through disease, disability and death, the worldwide burden of disease incurred by bathing in contaminated seawater is some 400,000 disability-adjusted life-years (a standard measure of time lost owing to premature death and time spent disabled by disease), comparable to the global impacts of diphtheria and leprosy. GESAMP and WHO estimated that the cost to society, worldwide, amounted to about $1.6 billion per year (GESAMP, 2001). Furthermore, harmful or toxic algal blooms can induce serious neurological disease and also have major financial impacts (Bechard, 2020; Diaz and others, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common pollutants tend to come from one of two places: humans or animals. Human faecal matter in water bodies constitutes the greatest public health threat because humans are reservoirs for many bacteria, parasites and viruses that are dangerous to other humans and can lead to a variety of illnesses. The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation. Drawing together the scientific work in the field, in 2003, WHO published Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments: Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003). More recently, WHO, with the support of the European Union, prepared recommendations on scientific, analytical and epidemiological developments relevant to the parameters for bathing-water quality, with special reference to Europe (WHO, 2018). WHO has indicated that the recommendations will inform the revision of the 2003 Guidelines (WHO, 2020). However, achievement of such standards requires adequate planning and infrastructure. Even where, as in some parts of India, strenuous efforts are being made to install properly operating sewage treatment systems, problems persist.

Fishes provide more than 4.5 billion people with at least 15 per cent of their animal protein intake. The nutritional properties of fishes make them important to the health of consumers in developed and developing countries. Fishes are efficient converters of feed into high quality food and their carbon footprint is lower than that of other animal production systems. Fisheries and aquaculture value chains contribute substantially to the income and employment, and therefore indirectly to the food security, of more than 10 per cent of the world’s population, principally in developing countries and emerging economies (FAO, 2017a).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 80 million tons of aquatic animals produced in 2016 contributed 46 per cent to total aquatic animal production and a little over 54  per  cent to total fish consumption in the same year.

However, the global extinction of the smooth handfish Sympterichthys unipennis (Last and others, 2020) is a reminder that fish biodiversity continues to face significant threats as well. Both positive and negative outcomes are known because fishes continue to be among the most systematically studied and monitored components of marine ecosystems, mostly because of their economic value. Nonetheless, considerable fish diversity remains to be discovered: expert estimates indicate that at least another 700 fish species (approximately a 50 per cent increase over the number of currently known species) are yet to be described from the New Zealand exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf alone (Gordon and others, 2010; Roberts and others, 2019). Further increase in capacity in taxonomy and biosystematics (Taxonomy Decadal Plan Working Group, 2018) and the integration of data from existing biodiversity collections (Nelson and others, 2015) and other sources (Edgar and others, 2016) would pave the way for more comprehensive, synthetic analyses of fish biodiversity over the near to medium term. In addition to improving our understanding of fish biodiversity, improved estimates of fish biomass are needed for some ocean zones, such as the pelagic zone. While it is estimated that mesopelagic fishes dominate global fish biomass, estimates of their biomass span several orders of magnitude and, therefore, the exact contribution that this group makes to global patterns remains poorly understood (Irigoien and others, 2014; Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). In addition, while there are no current estimates of species richness or biomass of bathypelagic fishes, which reside in the world’s largest environment (in terms of volume), it is highly likely that those fishes constitute a large portion of global fish biomass (Sutton and others, 2017). Since the first Assessment, the disposal of deep-sea mining water after ore removal has emerged as a significant threat to bathypelagic fishes (Drazen and others, 2019).

This is, of course, most significant in coastal seas. The tidal range varies according to local geography: the largest mean tidal ranges (around 11.7 metres) are found in the Bay of Fundy, on the Atlantic coast of Canada, but ranges only slightly less are also found in the Bristol Channel in the United Kingdom, on the northern coast of France, and on the coasts of Alaska, Argentina and Chile (NOAA 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal warming is likely to affect many aspects of ocean processes. Changes in seasurface temperature, sea level and other primary impacts will lead, among other things, to increases in the frequency of major tropical storms (cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons) bigger ocean swell waves and reduced polar ice formation. Each of these consequences has its own consequences, and so on (Harley et al., 2006; Occhipinti-Ambrogi, 2007). For example, reduced sea ice production in the polar seas will mean less bottom water is produced (Broecker, 1997) and hence less oxygen delivered to the deep ocean (Shaffer et al., 2009).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,3,5,5," What"],["B2117","2","How is aerobic life possible in deep ocean?","Como a vida aeróbia é possível no fundo do oceano?","","","Cold saltier water sinks into the deepest ocean basins, bringing oxygen and thus enabling aerobic life to exist.","Água fria e mais salgada afunda nas bacias oceânicas mais profundas, trazendo oxigênio e permitindo a existência de vida aeróbia.","Cold-salty water produced in sea ice “factories” sinks into the deepest ocean basins, bringing oxygen into the deep ocean and thus enabling aerobic life to exist.","Água salgada fria produzida em “fábricas” de gelo marinho afunda nas bacias oceânicas mais profundas, trazendo oxigênio para as profundezas do oceano e, assim, possibilitando a existência de vida aeróbia.","","\u003cp\u003eThe winds in the atmosphere are the main drivers of these ocean surface currents. The interface between the ocean and the atmosphere and the effect of the winds also allows for the ocean to absorb oxygen and, more importantly, carbon dioxide from the air.

Instead of being driven by winds and the temperature difference between the equator and the poles (as are the surface ocean currents), this current system is driven by differences in water density. The most dense ocean water is cold and salty which sinks beneath warm and fresh seawater that stays near the surface. Cold-salty water is produced in sea ice “factories” of the polar seas: when seawater freezes, the salt is rejected (the ice is mostly fresh water), which makes the remaining liquid seawater saltier.

The ocean is vast – it covers seven-tenths of the planet. On average, it is about 4,000 metres deep. It contains 1.3 billion cubic kilometres of water (97 per cent of all water on Earth). But there are now about seven billion people on Earth. So we each have just one-fifth of a cubic kilometre of ocean to provide us with all the services that we get from the ocean. That small, one-fifth of a cubic kilometre share produces half of the oxygen each of us breathes, all of the sea fish and other seafood that each of us eats. It is the ultimate source of all the freshwater that each of us will drink in our lifetimes. The ocean is a highway for ships that carry across the globe the exports and imports that we produce and consume. It contains the oil and gas deposits and minerals on and beneath the seafloor that we increasingly need to use. The submarine cables across the ocean floor carry 90 per cent of the electronic traffic on which our communications rely. Our energy supply will increasingly rely on wind, wave and tide power from the ocean. Large numbers of us take our holidays by the sea. That onefifth of a cubic kilometre will also suffer from the share of the sewage, garbage, spilled oil and industrial waste which we produce and which is put into the ocean every day. Demands on the ocean continue to rise: by the year 2050 it is estimated that there will be 10 billion people on Earth. So our share (or our children’s share) of the ocean will have shrunk to one-eighth of a cubic kilometre. That reduced share will still have to provide each of us with sufficient amounts of oxygen, food and water, while still receiving the pollution and waste for which we are all responsible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean is also home to a rich diversity of plants and animals of all sizes – from the largest animals on the planet (the blue whales) to plankton that can only be seen with powerful microscopes.

Even those which have no connection whatever with us humans are part of the biodiversity whose value we have belatedly recognized. However, the relationships are reciprocal. We intentionally exploit many components of this biodiverse richness. Carelessly (for example, through inputs of waste) or unknowingly (for example, through ocean acidification from increased emissions of carbon dioxide), we are altering the circumstances in which these plants and animals live. All this is affecting their ability to thrive and, sometimes, even to survive. These impacts of humanity on the oceans are part of our legacy and our future. They will shape the future of the ocean and its biodiversity as an integral physical-biological system, and the ability of the ocean to provide the services which we use now and will increasingly need to use in the future.

The most commonly valued services are tourism and recreation, as well as storm protection (Mehvar and others, 2018). Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries. Fishes and other seafood are a major source of food, protein and micronutrients for many vulnerable communities. It is estimated that, in 2016, 59.6 million people were employed in the primary sector of capture fisheries and aquaculture, with a great majority in low-income countries (although that figure includes some inland activities). With the addition of those who work in associated processing, marketing, distribution and supply industries, it is estimated that fisheries and aquaculture support nearly 250 million livelihoods (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits from marine and coastal ecosystems can be categorized in several ways.

While goods have a direct use (consumptive) value, determined through market prices, services and cultural benefits have an indirect use (non-consumptive) value that can be determined through the application of a variety of valuation techniques (see figure).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch1\u003eProvisioning services of marine and coastal ecosystems\u003c/h1\u003e  \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean provides a multitude of direct and indirect benefits of value to humans.

In 2016, 79.3 million tons of marine fishes2 were caught, and 28.7 million tons of marine aquaculture species were farmed, supplying together an average of 14.6 kg of seafood per person on earth (FAO, 2018).

Moreover, not all States have the capacity to participate fully in and benefit from the ocean and its resources. That may be because they either do not have access to the ocean, such as landlocked States, or do not have the financial means to develop maritime industries, which is the case for many developing countries. Some States do not have the capacity for access to areas beyond national jurisdiction or even parts of their own exclusive economic zone. For example, in areas beyond national jurisdiction, the collection of marine genetic resources, their sequencing and potential commercialization are currently concentrated in a small number of countries (Blasiak and others, 2018; 2019; Harden-Davies, 2019; Levin and Baker, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main provisioning services, living resources, is not only unevenly distributed, with productivity hotspots concentrated in the upwelling areas of the world (Kämpf and Chapman, 2016), but a very substantial proportion of capture fisheries is carried out by relatively few fishing vessels from few States. Vessels from 25 States took 42 per cent of the global catch in 2016 (FAO, 2018). Thus, profits are not necessarily going to the countries with the exclusive economic zone in which the fishes are produced.

Measured by adding up the total years of healthy life that are lost through disease, disability and death, the worldwide burden of disease incurred by bathing in contaminated seawater is some 400,000 disability-adjusted life-years (a standard measure of time lost owing to premature death and time spent disabled by disease), comparable to the global impacts of diphtheria and leprosy. GESAMP and WHO estimated that the cost to society, worldwide, amounted to about $1.6 billion per year (GESAMP, 2001).

The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation.

For example, some models predict that the warming ocean will increase the fish biomass available for harvesting in higher latitudes and decrease it in equatorial zones.

The tectonic plates have differing forms at their edges, giving broad or narrow continental shelves and varying profiles of the continental rises and continental slopes leading from the abyssal plain to the continental shelf. Geomorphic activity in the abyssal plains between the continents gives rise to abyssal ridges, volcanic islands, seamounts, guyots (plateau-like seamounts), rift valley segments and trenches. Erosion and sedimentation (either submarine or riverine when the sea level was lower during the ice ages) has created submarine canyons, glacial troughs, sills, fans and escarpments. Around the ocean basins there are marginal seas, partially separated by islands, archipelagos or peninsulas, or bounded by submarine ridges. These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe water of the ocean circulates within these geological structures. This water is not uniform: there are very important physical and chemical variations within the sea water. Salinity varies according to the relativity between inputs of freshwater and evaporation. Sea areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, with large amounts of freshwater coming from rivers and relatively low evaporation have low salinity – 8 parts per thousand and 16 parts per thousand, respectively, as compared with the global average of 35 parts per thousand (HELCOM 2010, Black Sea Commission 2008). The Red Sea, in contrast, with low riverine input and high insolation, and therefore high evaporation, has a mean surface salinity as high as 42.5 parts per thousand (Heilman et al 2009). Seawater can also be stratified into separate layers, with different salinities and different temperatures. Such stratification can lead to variations in both the oxygen content and nutrient content, with critical consequences in both cases for the biota dependent on them. A further variation is in the penetration of light. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis of inorganic carbon (mainly CO2) into the organic carbon of plants and mixotrophic species1 . Even clear water reduces the level of light that can penetrate by about 90 per cent for every 75 metres of depth. Below 200 metres depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis (Widder 2014). The upper 200 metres of the ocean are therefore where most photosynthesis takes place (the euphotic zone). Variations in light level in the water column and on the sea bed are caused by seasonal fluctuation in sunlight, cloud cover, tidal variations in water depth and (most significantly, where it occurs) turbidity in the water, caused, for example, by resuspension of sediment by tides or storms or by coastal erosion. Where turbidity occurs, it can reduce the penetration of light by up to 95 per cent, and thus reduce the level of photosynthesis which can take place (Anthony 2004).\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,3,5,4," Why"],["B2569","2","What is a hotspot?","O que é um hotspot?","What is the definition of a hotspot?","Qual é a definição de um hotspot?","Places where the marine life concentration are consistently high relative to adjacent areas.","Lugares com uma alta concentração de vida marinha em relação a áreas adjacentes.","A region where the number of species and the concentration of biotas are consistently high relative to adjacent areas.","Uma região em que o número de espécies e a concentração de biotas são consistentemente maiores relativamente a áreas adjacentes.","","\u003ch1\u003ePatterns of biodiversity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eLocation of biodiversity hotspots and their relationship to the location of high levels of ecosystem services\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough marine life is found everywhere in the ocean, biodiversity hotspots exist where the number of species and the concentration of biotas are consistently high relative to adjacent areas. Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean. The areas supporting high relative and absolute levels of biodiversity not only harbour unique species adapted to their special features, but also often serve as centres for essential life-history stages of species with wider distributions. For example, essentially all the biodiversity hotspots that have been identified have also been found to harbour juvenile fish, which are important for fisheries in adjacent areas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eHotspots for primary productivity are necessarily also hotspots for production of oxygen as a direct result of photosynthesis. Furthermore, underlying the high biodiversity is often a high structural complexity of the habitats that support it.

As sea-ice cover declines, this productivity may decline and open water species may increase. The high-latitude ecosystems are undergoing change at a rate more rapid than in other places on earth. In the past 100 years, average Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the average global rate. Reduced sea ice, especially a shift towards less multi-year sea ice, will affect a wide range of species in those waters. For example, owing to low reproductive rates and long lifetimes, some iconic species (including the polar bear) will be challenged to adapt to the current fast warming of the Arctic and may be extirpated from portions of their range within the next 100 years.\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2244","2","What will the changes in patterns of variability of oscillations, such as the El Niño, result in?","No que irão resultar as mudanças nos padrões de variabilidade das oscilações, como o El Niño?","What are the effects of patterns of variability of oscilations, such as the El Niño?","Quais são os efeitos de mudanças nos padrões de variabilidade das oscilações, tais como o El Niño?","They will bring climatic changes to many places and affect new areas, with consequent effects on agriculture and agricultural earnings","Eles trarão mudanças climáticas para muitos lugares e afetarão novas áreas, com conseqüentes efeitos na agricultura e nos ganhos agrícolas","It will bring climatic changes to many places.

Human faecal matter in water bodies constitutes the greatest public health threat because humans are reservoirs for many bacteria, parasites and viruses that are dangerous to other humans and can lead to a variety of illnesses. The cause of many problems can often be traced back to sewage overflows or leaky residential septic systems. Run-off from agricultural land can also represent a serious health concern, as faecal waste from farmed animals can contain pathogens, including various viruses, cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and salmonella, while pet waste on beaches can also pose health threats to humans (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2017; Moore and others, 2014; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to contaminated seawater thus affects the health of those enjoying recreation by the sea and adversely affects coastal tourism and recreation. Drawing together the scientific work in the field, in 2003, WHO published Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments: Coastal and Fresh Waters (WHO, 2003). More recently, WHO, with the support of the European Union, prepared recommendations on scientific, analytical and epidemiological developments relevant to the parameters for bathing-water quality, with special reference to Europe (WHO, 2018). WHO has indicated that the recommendations will inform the revision of the 2003 Guidelines (WHO, 2020). However, achievement of such standards requires adequate planning and infrastructure. Even where, as in some parts of India, strenuous efforts are being made to install properly operating sewage treatment systems, problems persist. For example, in Goa, a major tourist location, faecal coliform bacteria exceeded the relevant standards at all 10 of the beaches monitored (Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring of bathing water will not achieve its aim of improving public health without improvements in the communication to the public of the findings so that they are readily understandable. The current European Union legislation on bathing water (European Union, 2006) provides for standardized ways of publicizing the results of the monitoring that is required. Similar systems are found in various Australian States (New South Wales Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (NSW-DPIE), 2020; South Australia Environment Protection Agency (SA-EPA), 2020) and in the United States (WHOI, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change may be influencing the prevalence of microbial infections (Deeb and others, 2018; Konrad and others, 2017).

Noise, seabed disturbance and loss of biodiversity are frequent further significant impacts. In addition, the installation of pipelines and related infrastructure also contributes to certain discharges into the marine environment. The decommissioning of installations can also be carried out with more or less severe environmental impacts, depending on removal methodologies and subsequent environmental follow-up measures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eProduced water is a mix of oil and water from underground formations brought to the surface during production. The percentage of water, which is initially small, increases over time, while that of hydrocarbons decreases (Clark and Veil, 2009). The global average is estimated at three barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil (Khatib and Verbeek, 2002). Older wells, meanwhile, can display a ratio in excess of 50 barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. According to a study by IFP Énergies Nouvelles, produced water is set to exceed 300 million barrels per day in 2020 at the global level, an increase of 20 per cent over 2008 levels. Most of the increase is expected from offshore oil and gas production (IFP Énergies Nouvelles, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eDisposal options include injection into the same formation from where the oil is produced, treating the produced water to meet a certain quality standard and then either discharging it into the environment or using treated water in oil and gas field operations. While most of the treated produced water onshore is injected underground, in the offshore environment, it is discharged in the marine environment. Such discharges are often regulated by local or national water quality regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the United States. The United States Department of Energy is currently investing $4.6 million to fund projects that would advance produced water treatment technologies (Department of Energy, 2019).

Aggregations on spatially limited topographic features are highly vulnerable, and many target species are slow-growing and long-lived, therefore exhibiting little resilience to disturbance. Furthermore, most fisheries use bottom trawls, gear that is highly destructive to benthic communities. Little recolonization is observed years after closure to fishing.

First, there are the economic activities in providing goods and services which are often marketed (fisheries, shipping, communications, tourism and recreation, and so on). Secondly, there are the other tangible ecosystem services which are not part of a market, but which are vital to human life. For example, marine plants (mainly tiny floating diatoms) produce about 50 per cent of atmospheric oxygen. Mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses are also natural carbon sinks. Coastal habitats, including coral reefs, protect homes, communities and businesses from storm surges and wave attack. Thirdly, there are the intangible ecosystem services. We know that the ocean means far more to us than just merely the functional or practical services that it provides. Humans value the ocean in many other ways: for aesthetic, cultural or religious reasons, and for just being there in all its diversity – giving us a “sense of place” (Halpern et al., 2012). Not surprisingly, given the resources that the ocean provides, human settlements have grown up very much near the shore: 38 per cent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the shore, 44 per cent within 150 km, 50 per cent within 200 km, and 67 per cent within 400 km (Small et al 2004).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll these marine ecosystem services have substantial economic value. While there is much debate about valuation methods (and whether some ecosystem services can be valued) and about exact figures, attempts to estimate the value of marine ecosystem services have found such values to be on the order of trillions of US dollars annually (Costanza, et al., 1997). Nearly three-quarters of this value resides in coastal zones (Martínez, et al., 2007). The point is not so much the monetary figure that can be estimated for non-marketed ecosystem services, but rather the fact that people do not need to pay anything for them – these services are nature’s gift to humanity. But we take these services for granted at our peril, because the cost of replacing them, if it were possible to do so, would be immense and in many cases, incalculable.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,3,5,4," What"],["B2095","2","What are some practices that can increase the use of less-polluting pesticides?","Quais são algumas práticas que podem aumentar o uso de pesticidas menos poluentes?","Which practices can be used to increase the use of less-polluting pesticides?","Quais práticas podem ser usadas para aumentar o uso de pesticidas menos poluentes?","Education of farmers, supervision of distribution systems, and monitoring of the Ocean.","Educação dos agricultores,  supervisionamento dos sistemas de distribuição e monitoramento do Oceano.

In the case of fertilizers, their use is rapidly growing in parts of the world where only limited use had occurred in the past. That growth has the potential to lead to increased nutrient run-off to the ocean if the increased use of fertilizers is not managed well. There are therefore challenges in educating farmers, promoting good husbandry practices that cause less nutrient run-off and monitoring what is happening to agricultural run-off alongside sewage discharges. In the case of pesticides, the issues are analogous to those of industrial development. Newer pesticides are less polluting than older ones, but there are gaps in the capacity to ensure that these less-polluting pesticides are used, in terms of educating farmers, enabling them to afford the newer pesticides, supervising the distribution systems and monitoring what is happening in the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e ",true,true,3,5,4," What"],["B2060","2","What are the impacts of uncertainty for fisheries?","Quais são os impactos da incerteza em relação à pescaria?","How can the unvertainty for fisheries impact society?","Como a incerteza em relação à pescaria pode impactar a sociedade?","Impacts on food and economic security and undermining sustainable management","Impactos na segurança alimentar e econômica, além de prejudicar a gestão sustentável","social, economic and food security impacts, complicating sustainable management.","Impactos socioeconômicos e de segurança de alimentos.

Increasing water temperatures will also increase metabolic rates and, in some cases, the range and productivity of some stocks. The result is changes in ecosystems occurring at various rates ranging from near zero to very rapid. Research on those effects is scattered, with diverse results, but as ocean climate continues to change, those considerations are of increasing concern for food production.

These marginal seas have sometimes been formed in many ways: for example, some result from the interaction between tectonic plates (for example the Mediterranean), others from the sinking of former dry land as a result of isostatic changes from the removal of the weight of the ice cover in the ice ages (for example, the North Sea).\u003c/p\u003e",false,true,5,4,4," How"],["B2517","2","Why is the offshore oil and gas industry a concern for marine life?","Por que a indústria do petróleo e gás offshore representa uma preocupação à  vida marinha ?","What are the main threats from the offshore oil and gas industry to the marine ecosystem?","Quais as principais ameaças da indústria de petróleo e gás offshore para o ecossistema marinho?","For the historical recurrence of disasters and the use of harmful chemical inputs and products","Pela recorrência histórica de desastres e uso de insumos e produtos químicos  nocivos","Due to the spillage of harmful inputs.","Due to the spillage of harmful inputs.","","\u003ch1\u003eIncreasing inputs of harmful material\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOffshore hydrocarbon industries\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor disasters in the offshore oil and gas industry have a global, historical recurrence of one about every 17 years.

The other main harmful inputs from that sector are drilling cuttings (contaminated with drilling muds) resulting from the drilling of exploration and production wells, “produced water” (the water contaminated with hydrocarbons that comes up from wells, either of natural origin or through having been injected to enhance hydrocarbon recovery), and various chemicals that are used and discharged offshore in the course of exploration and exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThose materials can be harmful to marine life under certain circumstances.

Such regulation has been successfully introduced in a number of jurisdictions. Nonetheless, given the growth in exploration and offshore production, there is no doubt that those inputs are increasing over time, even though exact figures are not available globally.

Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean.

Growth in the first half of 2019 stood at 1 per cent, the weakest level since 2012 (IMF, 2019). Economic growth, when averaged across the global population (with vast geographical variability in economic growth, as noted in sect. 3), has resulted in the average annual income of an individual increasing from $3,300 in 1950 to $14,574 in 2016. The slowdown in growth is largely associated with weak manufacturing and trade. In contrast, service industries such as tourism have grown (IMF, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the global population has grown and the demand for goods and services has increased, there has been an associated increase in energy consumption and resource use.

At the same time, primary energy intensity, an indicator of how much energy is used by the global economy, slowed from 1.7 per cent in 2017 to 1.2 per cent in 2019 (IEA, 2019a). The slowing of efficiencies (i.e., the amount of GDP generated for the amount of energy used) is the result of a number of short-term factors, such as growth in fossil fuel-based electricity generation, and longer-term structural changes, such as a slowing transition towards less energy-intensive industries. At the same time, investment targeting energy efficiencies has been stable since 2014. Improvements in technical efficiency reduced energy-related carbon emissions by 3.5 gigatons of CO2 between 2015 and 2018 (IEA, 2019a). In addition, renewable energy production has grown as many countries shift to energy strategies that rely on it as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ocean energy production is part of many strategic developments and grew from 1 TWh (Terawatt hour) in 2014 to 1.2 TWh in 2018 (IEA, 2019b).

Marine and freshwater food production was a key protein provider and source of income for approximately 59.6 million people globally in 2016, an increase from 56.6 million in 2014. Although marine capture fisheries remain stable at around 80 million tons, mariculture is steadily increasing, from 26.8 million tons in 2014 to 28.7 million tons in 2016 (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018).

Currents form natural boundaries that help define distinct habitats. Such boundaries may isolate different genetic strains of the same species as well as different species. Many marine animals (for example, salmon and squid) have migration patterns that rely upon transport in major ocean current systems, and other species rely on currents to distribute their larvae to new habitats. Populations of ocean species naturally fluctuate from year to year, and ocean currents often play a significant role. The survival of plankton, for example, is affected by where the currents carry them. Food supply varies as changing circulation and upwelling patterns lead to higher or lower nutrient concentrations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe heterogeneity of the oceans, its water masses, currents, ecological processes, geological history and seafloor morphology, have resulted in great variations in the spatial distribution of life. In short, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed across the oceans: there are local and regional biodiversity “hotspots” (see Chapters 33 and 35). Figure 3 shows a way in which the diversity of species is consequently distributed around the world. Various classification systems have been devised to systematize this variety, including the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) (Davies and Moss, 1999; Connor et al., 2004) and the Global Open Ocean and Deep Sea-habitats (GOODS) classification and its refinements (Agnostini 2008; Rice et al 2011)).\u003c/p\u003e \n ",true,false,5,2,2," Why"],["B2207","2","What's ocean acidification?","O que é acidificação do oceano?","What can cause seawater to change chemistry to make it more acidic?","O que pode causar a mudança da química da água do mar tornando-a mais acida?","The change in seawater chemistry caused by ocean uptake of carbon dioxide emissions.","A mudança na química da água do mar causada pela absorção oceânica de emissões de dióxido de carbono.","It corresponds to the absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the oceans causing a rapid change in the chemistry of seawater.","Corresponde a absorção das emissões de dióxido de carbono pelos oceanos ocasionando a mudança rápida da química da água do mar.","","\u003ch1\u003ePressures from changes in ocean chemistry\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean uptake of carbon dioxide emissions is rapidly changing seawater chemistry in a process known as ocean acidification (see chap.  5). As the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater increases, it causes the carbonate saturation state to fall below levels suitable for globally important reef-forming taxa (Albright and others, 2018). Most coral reefs (shallow and deep) are vulnerable to rising CO2 concentrations (Lam and others, 2019). Ocean acidification is causing the depth at which seawater is corrosive to carbonate to shoal, threatening deepwater coral reefs worldwide through dissolution and intensified bioerosion (Gómez and others, 2018). Ocean acidification combines with warming, rising sea level and more severe storms to reduce reef resilience on a global scale and augment reef destruction. In the Arctic, there has been a rapid expansion in the area where surface seawater is corrosive to calcareous organisms (Brodie and others, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean acidification may affect all marine life, for example, through changes in gene expression, physiology, reproduction and behaviour (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; IPCC, 2019). Between 2005 and 2009, ocean acidification jeopardized a $270 million shellfish aquaculture industry that provided 3,200 jobs per year in Washington State, United States. Billions of oysters died in hatcheries because seawater had become corrosive to larval shells (Ekstrom and others, 2015). In addition to its negative impacts on calcifying phyto- and zooplankton, acidification can lower the nutritional value of seafood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOcean acidification also affects ecosystem properties, functions and services. Some groups of organisms do well in acidified conditions, but many taxa do not (Agostini and others, 2018). Many algae are resilient to the levels of ocean acidification projected under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP 8.5 scenario, yet shifts in community composition greatly alter seaweed habitats (Brodie and others, 2014; Enochs and others, 2015). Increased carbon availability stimulates primary production and can increase the standing stock of kelps and seagrasses (Russell and others, 2013; Linares and others, 2015; Cornwall and others, 2017), although microalgae and turf algae dominate acidified waters in exposed conditions (Agostini and others, 2018; Connell and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch at natural marine CO2 seeps has shown that there is about a 30  per  cent decrease in macrofaunal biodiversity as average pH declines from 8.1 to 7.8 (Agostini and others, 2018; Foo and others, 2018), which is attributable to direct effects, such as increased metabolic costs of coping with hypercapnia, or indirect effects, such as increased susceptibility to predation (Sunday and others, 2017). Some corals grow well in seawater with elevated CO2 concentrations, but the habitats they form lack diversity as reefs are degraded by ocean acidification owing to chemical dissolution and enhanced bioerosion, causing a shift to less diverse ecosystems. Chapter 7D also reviews the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs. The dual effects of increased CO2 and decreased carbonate alter trophic interactions. Reductions in the abundance and size of calcareous herbivores contribute to the overgrowth of weedy turf algae and a simplification of food webs, with losses in functional diversity (Vizzini and others, 2017; Teixidó and others, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e ",false,true,1,5,5," What"],["B2406","2","What was a major step in limiting the by-catch of several marine mammal and seabird species?","Qual foi o principal passo para limitar a captura acidental de várias espécies de mamíferos marinhos e aves marinhas?","How was the limitation of accidental captivity of different types of mammals and sea birds carried out?","Como foi realizada a limitação de cativeiros acidentais de diversos tipos de mamíferos e aves do mar?","The global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing called for by the General Assembly in 1991 was a major step in limiting the by-catch of several marine mammal and seabird species","A moratória global sobre toda a pesca pelágica com rede de deriva em grande escala, exigida pela Assembleia Geral em 1991, foi um passo importante para limitar a captura acidental de várias espécies de mamíferos marinhos e aves marinhas","The global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing called for by the General Assembly in 1991.","A moratória global sobre toda a pesca pelágica com rede de deriva em grande escala, exigida pela Assembleia Geral em 1991.","","\u003ch1\u003eHigher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eLevels of by-catch (non-target fish, marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds), discards and waste\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent estimates of the number of overfished stocks do not take into account the broader effects of fishing on marine ecosystems and their productivity.

Thanks to international efforts, fishing methods have changed and the by-catch has been reduced significantly. Commercial fisheries are the most serious pressure at sea that the world’s seabirds face, although there is evidence of some reductions of by-catch in some key fisheries. Each year, incidental by-catch in longline fisheries is estimated to kill at least 160,000 albatrosses and petrels, mainly in the southern hemisphere.

The diversity and technological sophistication of such structures attest to indigenous traditional knowledge of the ocean and its resources (Jeffery, 2013; Rowland and Ulm, 2011) Traditional watercraft such as the Hawaiian voyaging canoe Hōkūle`a provide an active platform for the restoration and maintenance of Pacific non-instrument navigation and cultural identity. Numerous other voyaging canoes have been constructed in the Pacific and, in many places, knowledge of traditional wayfinding has been preserved. Fautasi races in Samoa and dragon boat races in China merge history and cultural traditions with health, fitness and competition. People have long incorporated water-related activities as habitual or significant parts of their lives. Other non-consumptive ocean activities are swimming, diving, kayaking, surfing, sailing and wildlife viewing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, for many indigenous communities, fishing and the sharing of fishes form essential parts of traditional foodways, which support sociocultural cohesion and identity as well as linked ceremonial and cultural practices (Loring and others, 2019; Leong and others, 2020).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eOther cultural activities represent ways of reacting to the ocean (such as dances to celebrate the ocean or religious practices to safeguard against danger on the ocean).

One example is the role of whale hunting for the indigenous peoples of the western seaboard of Canada and the United States of America, as discussed in the first World Ocean Assessment. In Washington State, United States, one tribe, the Makah, has been pursuing special authorization to resume some whale hunting since 2005. In November 2019, a hearing was held for the tribe’s request and, in February 2020, a revised environmental impact assessment was published.

When the distances over which the cargoes were carried are taken into account, the growth in ton-miles is even larger (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 2019). Recovery is still in progress and has been seriously affected by the massive drop in world trade caused by the COVID-19 crisis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch growth, however, has occurred against a weak competitive background for the international shipping industry. The economic crisis that took place from 2008 to 2011 occurred during a time when world shipping had commissioned a large increase in tonnage to meet the increased freight demand of the preceding years. The additional tonnage was delivered at a time when demand had started to reduce, with the result that, during the 2010s, the shipping industry was operating against a background of oversupply, which had the consequence of depressing freight rates. As measures to further control the pollutant emissions from ships take effect (from 2020), further pressures associated with implementing modifications to fleets will be placed on the shipping industry. To meet the new requirements (as detailed in chap.  11), ships must either purchase bunkers with a lower sulfur content (which may have a higher price, since the traditional ships’ bunkers have been the high-sulfur oils for which there was less demand) or retrofit scrubbers to clean the ships’ exhaust. Further economic pressures of that kind are described in chapter  11. The combined effect of continuing overcapacity and higher operating costs remains unclear (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFor many years, the quantities of cargo loaded in ports in developing countries were smaller than those unloaded in those countries, marking an imbalance in seaborne trade. By the time of the first Assessment, the quantities, on average, were nearly in balance and, since then, the quantities loaded in developing countries now exceed those unloaded. Even excluding China, as the single largest developing country importer/exporter, there is still an excess of unloading in developing countries (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eContainertraffic continues to be focused on the main East-West arteries across the northern hemisphere (Asia-Europe, trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic), which account for 40 per cent of all container shipping.

At the same time, there is a growing tendency to consolidate container shipping, so the combined market share of the top 10 container shipping lines increased from 68 per  cent in 2014 to 90 per cent in 2019. That is combined with a returning interest in container shipping lines integrating their operations with traffic between originators and ports and between ports and the ultimate destinations. Those developments have the ability to undermine competition and thus to result in higher transit costs (UNCTAD, 2019).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe total world fleet of ships carrying all that cargo amounted to 96,295 ships in early 2019, accounting for 1.97 billion dead-weight tons of capacity. Bulk carriers and oil tankers maintained the largest market shares of vessels that dominated the world fleet, at 42.6 per cent of all vessels and 28.7 per cent of dead-weight tons, respectively. A large proportion of the world’s tonnage continues to be registered in a relatively small number of registries. Nearly 70 per cent of the world’s tonnage is registered in seven registries: Panama (17 per cent), Marshall Islands (12 per cent), Liberia (12 per cent), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (10 per  cent), Singapore (7 per  cent), Malta (6 per cent) and China (5 per cent).

In 2018, 47.2 per cent of the total reported tonnage of propelled seagoing vessels of 100 gross tons and above that were sold for demolition were demolished in Bangladesh, 25.6 per  cent in India, 21.5 per  cent in Pakistan, 2.3 per  cent in Turkey and 2 per  cent in China, leaving 1.4 per cent for the rest of the world.

Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMajor socioeconomic impacts will occur at locations where erosion coincides with high population density.

In a more recent work, Box and Colgan (2013) estimate marine ice loss at about twice the volume of meltwater (see Figure 5 in that article), with both marine ice loss and particularly runoff increasing rapidly since the late 1990s. According to the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP, 2011), the annual mass of freshwater being added at the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (the surface mass balance) has decreased since 1990. Model reconstructions suggest a 40% decrease from 350 Gt/y (1970 - 2000) to 200 Gt/y in 2007. Accelerating ice discharge from outlet glaciers since 1995 - 2002 is widespread and has gradually moved further northward along the west coast of Greenland with global warming. According to AMAP (2011), the ice discharge has increased from the pre-1990 value of 300 Gt/y to 400 Gt/y in 2005.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAntarctica’s climate is much colder, hence surface meltwater contributions are negligible and mass loss is dominated by submarine melting and ice flow across the grounding line where this ice meets the ocean floor (Rignot and Thomas, 2002). Freshwater fluxes from ice sheets differ from continental river runoff in two important respects. First, large fractions of both Antarctic ice sheets are grounded well below sea level in deep fjords or continental shelf embayments; therefore freshwater is injected not at the surface of the ocean but at several hundred meters water depth. This deep injection of freshwater enhances ocean stratification which, in turn, plays a role in ecosystem structure. Second, unlike rivers, which act as a point source for freshwater entering the ocean, icebergs calved at the grounding line constitute a distributed source of freshwater as they drift and melt in adjacent ocean basins (Bigg et al., 1997; Enderlin and Hamilton, 2014).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eSea ice is one of the smallest reservoirs of freshwater by volume, but it exhibits enormous seasonal variability in spatial extent as it waxes and wanes over the polar oceans. By acting as a rigid cap, sea ice modulates the fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean. Summertime melting of Arctic sea ice is an important source of freshwater flux into the North Atlantic, and episodes of enhanced sea ice export to warmer latitudes farther south give rise to rapid freshening episodes, such as the Great Salinity Anomaly of the late 1960s (Gelderloos et al., 2012). The spatial distributions of these freshwater fluxes drive important patterns in regional and global ocean circulation, which are discussed in Chapter 5.\u003c/p\u003e ",null,null,null,null,null,null],["B2208","2","How are regional fisheries management organizations contributing to the preservation of marine environments?","Como organizações regionais de gestão de pesca estão contribuindo para a preservação dos ambientes marinhos?",null,null,"By coordinating efforts aiming at the management of shared fishery resources, and in some regions, implementing effective stock rebuilding frameworks following overfishing.","Coordenando esforços visando a gestão de recursos pesqueiros compartilhados e, em algumas regiões, implementando estruturas eficazes de reconstrução de estoques após a sobrepesca.",null,null,"","\u003ch1\u003eChanging governance structures and geopolitical instability\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eMany international treaties and agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972, the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are aimed at reducing pressures on the marine environment and improving conservation outcomes. Targets set in association with international agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, have led to an increase in the establishment of marine protected areas and an associated increase in the protection of the marine environment.

Furthermore, the consolidation and concentration of company ownership has resulted in a few corporations or financiers often controlling large shares of the flows in any market (e.g., Bailey and others, 2018). Corporations have increased potential to negotiate directly with Governments, which could hamper progress towards sustainable outcomes for the marine environment. Where there is conflict over access to resources and property rights, policies and agreements focused on sustainability can be undermined by such conflicts (Suárez-de Vivero and Rodríguez Mateos, 2017).

Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion.

As a result, sea levels will rise more than the global mean in some regions, and will actually fall in others. A 4°C warming by 2100 (which is predicted in the high-end emissions scenario in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) would lead, by the end of that period, to a median sea-level rise of nearly 1 metre above the 1980 to 1999 levels.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOcean acidification\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eRising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are resulting in increased uptake of that gas by the ocean.

The resulting acidification of the ocean is occurring at different rates around the seas, but is generally decreasing the levels of calcium carbonate dissolved in seawater, thus lowering the availability of carbonate ions, which are needed for the formation by marine species of shells and skeletons.

First, there are the economic activities in providing goods and services which are often marketed (fisheries, shipping, communications, tourism and recreation, and so on). Secondly, there are the other tangible ecosystem services which are not part of a market, but which are vital to human life. For example, marine plants (mainly tiny floating diatoms) produce about 50 per cent of atmospheric oxygen. Mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses are also natural carbon sinks. Coastal habitats, including coral reefs, protect homes, communities and businesses from storm surges and wave attack. Thirdly, there are the intangible ecosystem services. We know that the ocean means far more to us than just merely the functional or practical services that it provides. Humans value the ocean in many other ways: for aesthetic, cultural or religious reasons, and for just being there in all its diversity – giving us a “sense of place” (Halpern et al., 2012). Not surprisingly, given the resources that the ocean provides, human settlements have grown up very much near the shore: 38 per cent of the world’s population live within 100 km of the shore, 44 per cent within 150 km, 50 per cent within 200 km, and 67 per cent within 400 km (Small et al 2004).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAll these marine ecosystem services have substantial economic value. While there is much debate about valuation methods (and whether some ecosystem services can be valued) and about exact figures, attempts to estimate the value of marine ecosystem services have found such values to be on the order of trillions of US dollars annually (Costanza, et al., 1997). Nearly three-quarters of this value resides in coastal zones (Martínez, et al., 2007). The point is not so much the monetary figure that can be estimated for non-marketed ecosystem services, but rather the fact that people do not need to pay anything for them – these services are nature’s gift to humanity. But we take these services for granted at our peril, because the cost of replacing them, if it were possible to do so, would be immense and in many cases, incalculable.\u003c/p\u003e ",null,null,null,null,null,null],["B2278","2","What are the main factors that lead to biodiversity?","Quais são os principais fatores que levam à biodiversidade?",null,null,"The complexity of the environment and its physical structures","A complexidade do ambiente e de suas estruturas físicas",null,null,"","\u003ch1\u003ePatterns of biodiversity\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eLocation of biodiversity hotspots and their relationship to the location of high levels of ecosystem services\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough marine life is found everywhere in the ocean, biodiversity hotspots exist where the number of species and the concentration of biotas are consistently high relative to adjacent areas.

Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore.

Those changes in patterns result in significant changes in weather patterns on land. Water masses are also moving differently in areas over continental shelves, with consequent effects on the distribution of species.

That rise is due in part to anthropogenic warming, causing ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and of the polar continental ice sheets. Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion. Some of the remainder is due to fluxes of freshwater from the continents, which have increased as a result of the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, regional and local sea-level changes are also influenced by natural factors, such as regional variability in winds and ocean currents, vertical movements of the land, isostatic adjustment of the levels of land in response to changes in physical pressures on it and coastal erosion, combined with human perturbations by change in land use and coastal development. As a result, sea levels will rise more than the global mean in some regions, and will actually fall in others. A 4°C warming by 2100 (which is predicted in the high-end emissions scenario in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) would lead, by the end of that period, to a median sea-level rise of nearly 1 metre above the 1980 to 1999 levels.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003ch2\u003eOcean acidification\u003c/h2\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eRising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are resulting in increased uptake of that gas by the ocean.

The resulting acidification of the ocean is occurring at different rates around the seas, but is generally decreasing the levels of calcium carbonate dissolved in seawater, thus lowering the availability of carbonate ions, which are needed for the formation by marine species of shells and skeletons.

They include climate change, the extraction of resources, pollution (from land and marine sources) and invasive species, resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease (e.g., Evans and others, 2017). The aim of ecosystem-based management is to balance human activities with environmental stewardship in order to maintain ecosystem properties, functions and services. That requires an appreciation of how and to what extent human activities and natural events interact and affect ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by such interactions (Halpern and others, 2008; Levin and others, 2009; Ban and others, 2010; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010). Those interactions are known as cumulative impacts or cumulative effects.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms “cumulative impacts” and “cumulative effects” are often used interchangeably to describe how pressures affect ecosystems. The use of standardized language is key to the transfer of knowledge, assessment approaches and expertise across management boundaries and among stakeholders and organizations. A preference for the use of the term “cumulative effects” has been identified, noting that impacts are hypothesized and have been either not directly observed or attributed (Murray and others, 2015). For consistency, the term “cumulative effects” is used in the present chapter. There is as yet no universally accepted definition of cumulative effects and impacts, with definitions varying in the literature, depending on what is being assessed, and the context within which the assessment is being undertaken (e.g., Anthony, 2016; Spaling and Smit, 1993; Hegmann and others, 1999; Halpern and others, 2008; Johnson, 2016; Uthicke and others, 2016). The present chapter follows the premise that effects can be defined as a change to the environment, including its human components, while impacts represent the consequences of such change (Johnson, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four general types of cumulative effects: additive, synergistic, antagonistic (compensatory) and masking (Sonntag and others, 1987; Hegmann and others, 1999; Crain and others, 2008; Halpern and others, 2008). Additive effects are incremental additions to the pressures caused by an activity, with each increment adding to previous increments over time. Synergistic effects, also referred to as amplifying or exponential effects, magnify the consequences of individual pressures to produce a joint consequence that is greater than the additive effect. Antagonistic or compensatory effects produce a joint consequence that is less than additive. Masking effects produce essentially the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the pressures alone. Impacts that can be considered cumulative may result from a single activity that repeatedly produces a single pressure, a single activity that produces multiple pressures, multiple activities that produce a single pressure or multiple activities that produce multiple pressures over time (Foley and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e ",null,null,null,null,null,null],["B2460","2","What are the benefits of using natural ecosystems as barriers for flooding over artificial structures?","Quais são os benefícios de se utilizar ecossistemas naturais como barreiras contra enchentes ao invés de estruturas artificiais?",null,null,"Natural ecosystems, in addition to protecting the land, provide their valuable ecosystem functions and services and do not require the large maintenance and expansion efforts in the long term that hard engineered barriers do.","Ecossistemas naturais, além de proteger o território, proporcionam suas valiosas funções e serviços de ecossistemas e, ao mesmo tempo, não exigem grandes esforços de manutenção e expansão a longo prazo como o que ocorre com barreiras artificiais.",null,null,"","\u003ch1\u003eSea level rise and cities\u003c/h1\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eCities located along coastlines and in archipelagic and island States are becoming increasingly susceptible to erosion and sea level rise (De Sherbinin and others, 2007; Hanson and others, 2011; Takagi and others, 2016). Many comprise large areas of reclaimed land (the gain of land from the sea, wetlands or other water bodies), which is retained and protected from erosion by hard engineered structures, such as sea walls and rock armouring (Sengupta and others, 2018). It is likely that many of such engineered coastlines will need to be adapted and upgraded to keep pace with rising sea levels. In highly urbanized environments that are often already heavily degraded, hard engineered structures are often the only option available and are considered to be successful options (Hallegatte and others, 2013; Hinkel and others, 2014), but there are a wide range of broader negative impacts of land reclamation and those structures on the surrounding environment (Dafforn and others, 2015). Globally, many regions (especially cities) are claiming that more than 50 per cent of their coastlines are armoured (e.g., Chapman, 2003; Burt and others, 2013), and that number will likely rise in the future in response to burgeoning economies, coastal populations and urbanization (e.g., see plans for the reclamation of the entire coastlines of two Malaysian states in Chee and others, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an alternative to hard engineered coastal defences, construction of which is complex and expensive, where possible, natural coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes should be used as natural barriers or combined with hard infrastructure using hybrid approaches (Temmerman and others, 2013). The use of such ecosystems can not only protect the land but also provide valuable ecosystem functions and services. As hard engineered coastal defences may be considered an effective short-term solution to coastal flooding, more investment will be needed owing to observed increasing storminess and sea level rise (Mendelsohn and others, 2012; Vitousek and others, 2017). By 2010, the global average sea level was calculated to be 52.4 mm above the 1993 level and, by 2018, it had risen to 89.9 mm above the 1993 level (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2019). The rate of change is also increasing. For the period 1993–2018, the rate of increase was calculated at 3.2 mm per year, while for the period 2010–2018, it was calculated to be much faster, at 4.7 mm per year. Despite significant uncertainties remaining, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea level rise will continue for centuries, even if mitigation measures are put in place. The potential widespread collapse of ice shelves could lead to a larger twenty-first century sea level rise of up to several tenths of a metre (Church and others, 2013), which will have drastic consequences for coastal, archipelagic and small island cities, in particular those in low-lying areas.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eUrbanization could, however, also provide opportunities for risk reduction, given that cities are engines of economic growth and centres of innovation, political attention and private sector investments (Garschagen and Romero-Lankao, 2015). Hallegatte and others (2013) conducted a global analysis of present and future losses in the 136 largest coastal cities. They predicted that global flood losses would increase from an average of $6 billion per year in 2005 to $1 trillion by 2050, with projected socioeconomic change, climate change and subsidence. Even if adaptation investments remain constant, flood probability, subsidence and sea level rise will increase global flood losses to $60 billion–$63 billion per year in 2050. The same study found that developing countries are particularly vulnerable to flood risk, with much lower investment in flood protection measures (Hallegatte and others, 2013).\u003c/p\u003e ",null,null,null,null,null,null],["B2283","2","Why the concern about the increase of the sea-surface temperature must be even higher than those from other sources?","Por que a preocupação com o aumento da temperatura marítima deve ser ainda maior do que aquela com outras fontes?",null,null,"Ocean's large mass and high heat capacity enable it to store more than 1000 times the energy found in the atmosphere, for the same increase in temperature.

Upper-ocean temperature (and hence its heat content) varies over multiple time scales, including seasonal, inter-annual (for example, those associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation), decadal and centennial periods. Depth-averaged ocean-temperature trends from 1971 to 2010 are positive (that is, they show warming) over most of the globe. The warming is more prominent in the northern hemisphere, especially in the North Atlantic. Zonally averaged upper-ocean temperature trends show warming at nearly all latitudes and depths. However, the greater volume of the ocean in the southern hemisphere increases the contribution of its warming to the global heat content.\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean’s large mass and high heat capacity enable it to store huge amounts of energy, more than 1,000 times than that found in the atmosphere for an equivalent increase in temperature.

The ocean has absorbed about 93 per cent of the combined extra heat stored by warmed air, sea, land, and melted ice between 1971 and 2010. During the past three decades, approximately 70 per cent of the world’s coastline has experienced significant increases in sea-surface temperature. This has been accompanied by an increase in the yearly number of extremely hot days along 38 per cent of the world’s coastline. Warming has also been occurring at a significantly earlier date in the year along approximately 36 per cent of the world’s temperate coastal areas (between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres).
