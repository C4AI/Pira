A1842,"Geologic events related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean deeply influenced the sedimentary record of the Araripe Basin. As consequence, upper stratigraphic units of the basin record a marine ingression in northeastern Brazil during the late Aptian. The timing and stratigraphic architecture of these units are crucial to understand the paleogeography of Gondwana and how the proto-Atlantic Ocean reached interior NE Brazil during the early Cretaceous. This marine ingression is recorded in the Araripe Basin as the Romualdo Formation, characterized by a transgressive-regressive cycle bounded by two regional unconformities. In the eastern part of the basin, the Romualdo depositional sequence comprises coastal alluvial and tide-dominated deposits followed by marine transgressive facies characterized by two fossil-rich intervals: a lower interval of black shales with fossil-rich carbonate concretions (Konservat-Lagerstätten) and an upper level with mollusk-dominated shell beds and shelly limestones. Following the marine ingression, an incomplete regressive succession of marginal-marine facies records the return of continental environments to the basin. The stratigraphic framework based on the correlation of several sections defines a transgressive-regressive cycle with depositional dip towards southeast, decreasing in thickness towards northwest, and with source areas located at the northern side of the basin.

A1950,"Deep-sea fans have been proposed to act as carbon sinks, rapid deposition driving shallow methanogenesis to favor net storage within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Here, we present new evidence of widespread gas venting from the GHSZ on the upper Amazon deep-sea fan, together with analyses of the first samples of gas hydrates recovered offshore NE Brazil. Multibeam water column and seafloor imagery over an 18,000-km² area of the upper Amazon fan reveal 53 water column gas plumes, rising from venting features in water depths of 650–2600 m. Most gas vents (60%) are located along seafloor faults that record the ongoing gravitational collapse of the fan above deep décollements, while others (40%) are located in water depths of 650–715 m within the upper edge of the GHSZ. Gas compositions from hydrates recovered in vents at three locations on and north of the fan indicate biogenic sources (dominantly methane with 2–15% of CO2; δ¹³C from − 81.1 to − 77.3‰), whereas samples from vents adjacent to the fan proper include possible thermogenic contributions (methane 95%, CO2 4%, and ethane 1%; δ¹³C – 59.2‰). These results concur with previous findings that the upper edge of the GHSZ may be sensitive to temporal changes in water temperatures, but further point to the importance of gas escape from within areas of gas hydrate stability.

A688,"Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree. After being disassembled, the new subsea safety tree was inspected; the inspection showed minimal damage and erosion on the inside walls of the tool, indicating that the equipment would qualify for this type of offshore operation.

A1595,"The use of zinc isotopes to trace anthropogenic sources in coastal areas has been tested in this study. We determined the stable isotopic composition of zinc in sediment cores, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and rocks collected at the Sepetiba Bay (southeastern Brazil), an estuarine lagoon heavily impacted by metallurgic activities. These isotopic signatures were compared with those from willemite ore, which represent the main mineral refined by the major industrial source of zinc. The aim was to test if this tracer system enables to identify sources and sinks of anthropogenic zinc and to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of zinc contamination. The zinc isotopic compositions (expressed using the δ66Zn notation relative to the JMC 3-0749-L solution) showed significant variations in the sediment cores, the SPM, and willemite ore minerals, ranging between −0.01 and +1.15‰. Spatial and temporal analysis of sediments samples fit well in a model of mixing involving three main end-members: i) Terrestrial background (δ66ZnJMC = +0.28 ± 0.12‰, 2σ); ii) marine detrital material (δ66ZnJMC = +0.45 ± 0.03‰, 2σ); and iii) a major anthropogenic source associated with electroplating wastes released into the bay (δ66ZnJMC = +0.86 ± 0.15‰, 2σ). Sediment cores collected in the mud flats showed high correlation between δ66Zn and zinc enrichment factors, suggesting good preservation of the isotopic records of natural and anthropogenic sources.

A1590,"Passive margins underlain by a salt detachment are typically interpreted as kinematically linked zones of updip extension and downdip contraction separated by a zone of translation above a smoothly dipping base of salt. However, salt flow is affected by the base-of-salt geometry across which it flows, and early-stage gravity gliding induced by basin tilt may be complicated by the presence of salt-thickness changes caused by the pre-existing base-salt relief. We investigate these effects using physical models. Dip-parallel steps generate strike-slip fault zones separating domains of differential downslope translation and structural styles, provided the overburden is thin enough. If the overburden is thicker, it resists breakup, but a change in the structural trend occurs across the step. Steps with mild obliquity to the dip direction produce transtensional and transpressional faults in the cover separating structural domains. Deformation complexity in the overburden increases where base-salt steps strike at a high angle to salt flow, and it is especially dependent on the ratio between the thick (T) and thin (t) salt across the step at the base of salt. Where the salt-thickness ratio (T/t) is high, basal drag generates major flux mismatches, resulting in a contractional thickening of the salt and associated overburden shortening in thin salt above a base-salt high block. Shortening is transient and superseded by extension as the salt thickening allows the flow velocity to increase. When transitioning off a base-salt high block into a low block, the greater flux within the thick salt results in a monocline with extensional and contractional hinges. Structures are further deformed as they translate through these hinge zones. Our physical models demonstrate that extensional diapirs and compressional fold belts can be initiated anywhere on a slope as the salt accelerates and decelerates across base-salt relief. A fold belt from the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, is used to illustrate these processes.

A1172,"The acoustic patterns variation can be used to understand the sediment distribution extrapolating the information to places where is not possible to take any sample. Many authors already use this integrated method to investigate interest areas in, both, commercial and scientific aspect. In this direction the current study initiated in 2009 in the frame of the Geochemistry Network PETROBRAS/CENPES, aims to track the quaternary evolution of a muddy bank situated at the coastal western boundary upwelling system (WBUS) off Cabo Frio (23oS) in the Atlantic Ocean. The WBUS is located at the north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Here the coastline orientation differs from the default East-West direction of the Brazilian coast, concomitant with the boundary of the Campos and Santos Basins, the most important oil and gas basins of the country. The upwelling phenomenon occurs due to constant northeast winds. The same winds combined with the Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation also promote a curl confluence making the environment even more complex. Seismic data was acquired in cruises on board the RV Ocean Survey. Altogether 680 km was covered by a 3.5 KHz sub-bottom using the Geopulse Geoacustic System. Further, four piston cores were collected to be scan and described in physic parameters and sedimentological content, respectively. The scan was performed using a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL), which measure and register the Vp, gamma density and porosity of the core. After the scan, the cores were sample and analyzed on sedimentological grain size distribution determined by a Cilas 1064 laser analyzer. The results were integrated in order to identify common trends. Three major echo-characters were described in seismic records. Grain size analysis presented a good relationship with these echos. Echo A) Transparent, represented by a sharp bottom reflector with no sub-bottom reflectors scatter of a transparent layer mapped in seismic records. The grain size distribution is more balanced with a slight higher content of sands (55 %) in the correspondent core. Echo B) Stratified described as a series of parallel sub-bottom horizons, its percentage of clays is the highest of the three cores (77 %). The last echo, C) Reflexive, is a prolonged echo with one or none sub-bottom reflector. This echo is related to the highest percentage of sands of the three cores (61%).

The acoustic patterns variation can be used to understand the sediment distribution extrapolating the information to places where is not possible to take any sample. Many authors already use this integrated method to investigate interest areas in, both, commercial and scientific aspect. In this direction the current study initiated in 2009 in the frame of the Geochemistry Network PETROBRAS/CENPES, aims to track the quaternary evolution of a muddy bank situated at the coastal western boundary upwelling system (WBUS) off Cabo Frio (23oS) in the Atlantic Ocean. The WBUS is located at the north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Here the coastline orientation differs from the default East-West direction of the Brazilian coast, concomitant with the boundary of the Campos and Santos Basins, the most important oil and gas basins of the country. The upwelling phenomenon occurs due to constant northeast winds. The same winds combined with the Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation also promote a curl confluence making the environment even more complex. Seismic data was acquired in cruises on board the RV Ocean Survey. Altogether 680 km was covered by a 3.5 KHz sub-bottom using the Geopulse Geoacustic System. Further, four piston cores were collected to be scan and described in physic parameters and sedimentological content, respectively. The scan was performed using a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL), which measure and register the Vp, gamma density and porosity of the core. After the scan, the cores were sample and analyzed on sedimentological grain size distribution determined by a Cilas 1064 laser analyzer. The results were integrated in order to identify common trends. Three major echo-characters were described in seismic records. Grain size analysis presented a good relationship with these echos. Echo A) Transparent, represented by a sharp bottom reflector with no sub-bottom reflectors scatter of a transparent layer mapped in seismic records. The grain size distribution is more balanced with a slight higher content of sands (55 %) in the correspondent core. Echo B) Stratified described as a series of parallel sub-bottom horizons, its percentage of clays is the highest of the three cores (77 %). The last echo, C) Reflexive, is a prolonged echo with one or none sub-bottom reflector. This echo is related to the highest percentage of sands of the three cores (61%). The sediment analysis was extrapolated all over the echo-characters extension to understand the transport regime over the area. This criteria, allied to isopach map, made possible to recognize three distinct zones inside the muddy accumulation.

A409,"The ""pseudo-sticking and pull"", also nicknamed ""blocky effect"" (because of its general aspect), is a common acquisition artifact that reduces considerably the quality of wireline acoustic and microresistive image logs, even though it is not well known among image log interpreters, well-site geologists and engineers. This artifact is generated by heave motion influence when the wave movement is not minimized enough by the compensation systems during offshore wireline operations. In fact, it is well known that the linear or rotary compensator systems reduce the heave variance between 52-80% and, sometimes, other factors such as string weight and fluid density can affect, significantly, wireline logs quality by the heave variance not well compensated. In this case, mainly the wireline stationary tools and the ones that need lower acquisition speed, present depth uncertainties that may cause relevant problems. The image logs are largely used in pre-salt reservoirs for geomechanics, petrophysics, structural, sedimentological and stratigraphic studies due to their great contrast responses on carbonates. However, because acoustic image logs run at speeds around 425 ft/h (against 3600 ft/h from basic logs) and acquire between 180 and 250 samples data each 0,2 inches depth, this log becomes more affected by this artifact than the microresistive one (over 1500 ft/h). The residual heave affects directly the image quality by creating ""pseudo-sticking and pull"" at each wave period, distorting the image log significantly. Besides the artifact that immediately appears on the image during the logging, the residual heave can also be confirmed by observing when cable tension and vector Z accelerometer variation have the same frequency as the period of ocean waves, monitored by the meteo-oceanographic daily reports. Even though this artifact can be minimized with processing (better than true sticking and pull corrections), the loss of quality should be considered. Petrobras experience has also shown that interventions directly on the source by adjusting compensators and changing steering towards can be effective to handle this problem. In order to help the interested community in acquiring better data with minimum costs, this work shows some examples of this artifact on acoustic image logs from pre-salt wells.

B2063,"Impacts of climate change and related changes in the atmosphere Sea-level rise It is very likely that extreme sea-level maxima have already increased globally since the 1970s, mainly as a result of global mean sea-level rise. That rise is due in part to anthropogenic warming, causing ocean thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and of the polar continental ice sheets. Globally averaged sea level has thus risen by 3.2 mm a year for the past two decades, of which about a third is derived from thermal expansion. Some of the remainder is due to fluxes of freshwater from the continents, which have increased as a result of the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets. Finally, regional and local sea-level changes are also influenced by natural factors, such as regional variability in winds and ocean currents, vertical movements of the land, isostatic adjustment of the levels of land in response to changes in physical pressures on it and coastal erosion, combined with human perturbations by change in land use and coastal development. As a result, sea levels will rise more than the global mean in some regions, and will actually fall in others. A 4°C warming by 2100 (which is predicted in the high-end emissions scenario in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) would lead, by the end of that period, to a median sea-level rise of nearly 1 metre above the 1980 to 1999 levels.

B2207,"Pressures from changes in ocean chemistry Ocean uptake of carbon dioxide emissions is rapidly changing seawater chemistry in a process known as ocean acidification (see chap. 5). As the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater increases, it causes the carbonate saturation state to fall below levels suitable for globally important reef-forming taxa (Albright and others, 2018). Most coral reefs (shallow and deep) are vulnerable to rising CO2 concentrations (Lam and others, 2019). Ocean acidification is causing the depth at which seawater is corrosive to carbonate to shoal, threatening deepwater coral reefs worldwide through dissolution and intensified bioerosion (Gómez and others, 2018). Ocean acidification combines with warming, rising sea level and more severe storms to reduce reef resilience on a global scale and augment reef destruction. In the Arctic, there has been a rapid expansion in the area where surface seawater is corrosive to calcareous organisms (Brodie and others, 2014). Ocean acidification may affect all marine life, for example, through changes in gene expression, physiology, reproduction and behaviour (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; IPCC, 2019). Between 2005 and 2009, ocean acidification jeopardized a $270 million shellfish aquaculture industry that provided 3,200 jobs per year in Washington State, United States. Billions of oysters died in hatcheries because seawater had become corrosive to larval shells (Ekstrom and others, 2015). In addition to its negative impacts on calcifying phyto- and zooplankton, acidification can lower the nutritional value of seafood. Ocean acidification also affects ecosystem properties, functions and services. Some groups of organisms do well in acidified conditions, but many taxa do not (Agostini and others, 2018). Many algae are resilient to the levels of ocean acidification projected under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP 8.5 scenario, yet shifts in community composition greatly alter seaweed habitats (Brodie and others, 2014; Enochs and others, 2015). Increased carbon availability stimulates primary production and can increase the standing stock of kelps and seagrasses (Russell and others, 2013; Linares and others, 2015; Cornwall and others, 2017), although microalgae and turf algae dominate acidified waters in exposed conditions (Agostini and others, 2018; Connell and others, 2018). Research at natural marine CO2 seeps has shown that there is about a 30 per cent decrease in macrofaunal biodiversity as average pH declines from 8.1 to 7.8 (Agostini and others, 2018; Foo and others, 2018), which is attributable to direct effects, such as increased metabolic costs of coping with hypercapnia, or indirect effects, such as increased susceptibility to predation (Sunday and others, 2017). Some corals grow well in seawater with elevated CO2 concentrations, but the habitats they form lack diversity as reefs are degraded by ocean acidification owing to chemical dissolution and enhanced bioerosion, causing a shift to less diverse ecosystems. Chapter 7D also reviews the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs. The dual effects of increased CO2 and decreased carbonate alter trophic interactions. Reductions in the abundance and size of calcareous herbivores contribute to the overgrowth of weedy turf algae and a simplification of food webs, with losses in functional diversity (Vizzini and others, 2017; Teixidó and others, 2018).

Ocean acidification is causing the depth at which seawater is corrosive to carbonate to shoal, threatening deepwater coral reefs worldwide through dissolution and intensified bioerosion (Gómez and others, 2018). Ocean acidification combines with warming, rising sea level and more severe storms to reduce reef resilience on a global scale and augment reef destruction. In the Arctic, there has been a rapid expansion in the area where surface seawater is corrosive to calcareous organisms (Brodie and others, 2014). Ocean acidification may affect all marine life, for example, through changes in gene expression, physiology, reproduction and behaviour (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2015; IPCC, 2019). Between 2005 and 2009, ocean acidification jeopardized a $270 million shellfish aquaculture industry that provided 3,200 jobs per year in Washington State, United States. Billions of oysters died in hatcheries because seawater had become corrosive to larval shells (Ekstrom and others, 2015). In addition to its negative impacts on calcifying phyto- and zooplankton, acidification can lower the nutritional value of seafood. Ocean acidification also affects ecosystem properties, functions and services. Some groups of organisms do well in acidified conditions, but many taxa do not (Agostini and others, 2018). Many algae are resilient to the levels of ocean acidification projected under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCP 8.5 scenario, yet shifts in community composition greatly alter seaweed habitats (Brodie and others, 2014; Enochs and others, 2015). Increased carbon availability stimulates primary production and can increase the standing stock of kelps and seagrasses (Russell and others, 2013; Linares and others, 2015; Cornwall and others, 2017), although microalgae and turf algae dominate acidified waters in exposed conditions (Agostini and others, 2018; Connell and others, 2018). Research at natural marine CO2 seeps has shown that there is about a 30 per cent decrease in macrofaunal biodiversity as average pH declines from 8.1 to 7.8 (Agostini and others, 2018; Foo and others, 2018), which is attributable to direct effects, such as increased metabolic costs of coping with hypercapnia, or indirect effects, such as increased susceptibility to predation (Sunday and others, 2017). Some corals grow well in seawater with elevated CO2 concentrations, but the habitats they form lack diversity as reefs are degraded by ocean acidification owing to chemical dissolution and enhanced bioerosion, causing a shift to less diverse ecosystems. Chapter 7D also reviews the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs. The dual effects of increased CO2 and decreased carbonate alter trophic interactions. Reductions in the abundance and size of calcareous herbivores contribute to the overgrowth of weedy turf algae and a simplification of food webs, with losses in functional diversity (Vizzini and others, 2017; Teixidó and others, 2018).

Question: What's ocean acidification? 

  A: It evidences the alteration of the water cycle of the global ocean in a period coinciding with its warming. 
  B: Acidification is not evenly distributed. 
  C: Ocean warming and land ice melt. 
  D: A variety of options exist to deal with critical levels of marine litter, some of which include approaches to address the issue, while understanding that not all are applicable to or supported by every country and some do not consider adverse impacts: the reduction of plastic consumption; support for eco-design and innovation (especially research into end-of-life plastic issues and alternatives); resource efficiency and better management of waste and water; long-term, efficient and viable recycling targets for municipal waste, packaging and plastic waste; greater use of policy instruments and control measures, including incentives, taxes and other regulatory measures, such as bans or extended producer responsibility schemes; and the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives and the coordination of policy investments in the waste sector. There is also a need for tight regulation and supervision of global waste trading, especially scrap plastic.

A174,"Shipyards impact on estuarine environments because of the use of antifouling paints and petroleum products, which release trace metals that may remain in their bioavailable or labile form. Regardless of its importance, the relation between continuous input of trace metals (hotspot area) and their availability in the water column has been scarcely studied. This study evaluated seasonal variations in the concentrations of labile fractions of metals in shipyards located in estuarine areas on the Brazilian subtropical coast. These fractions were determined by the Diffuse Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique. Maximum labile fraction concentrations of Cr (0.3 μg L-1), Ni (2.2 μg L-1) and V (2.0 μg L-1) are directly related to (i) their specific source: antifouling paints (for Cr), metal and steel alloys (for Cr and Ni) and petroleum products (for V), besides (ii) periods of intensive traffic and vessel repair. Additionally, variations in labile fractions of Ni and V in the Patos Lagoon estuary were influenced by salinity, which is known to affect metal desorption from surface sediments in resuspension events. Even though Cr is affected by the same processes, it is available as Cr(III) and does not represent any ecological risk in the study areas. Although the areas under study are affected by variations in physical and chemical conditions, shipyards were effectively hotspots of trace metals in their labile fraction in various estuarine systems in southeastern and southern Brazil. Thus, they represent areas where Ecological Risk Assessment, mainly of V, should be carried out.

",The by-catch of seabirds and the depletion of their prey caused by fishing. ,The shipyards.,C,"Based on the following context:

Shipyards impact on estuarine environments because of the use of antifouling paints and petroleum products, which release trace metals that may remain in their bioavailable or labile form. Regardless of its importance, the relation between continuous input of trace metals (hotspot area) and their availability in the water column has been scarcely studied. This study evaluated seasonal variations in the concentrations of labile fractions of metals in shipyards located in estuarine areas on the Brazilian subtropical coast. These fractions were determined by the Diffuse Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique. Maximum labile fraction concentrations of Cr (0.3 μg L-1), Ni (2.2 μg L-1) and V (2.0 μg L-1) are directly related to (i) their specific source: antifouling paints (for Cr), metal and steel alloys (for Cr and Ni) and petroleum products (for V), besides (ii) periods of intensive traffic and vessel repair. Additionally, variations in labile fractions of Ni and V in the Patos Lagoon estuary were influenced by salinity, which is known to affect metal desorption from surface sediments in resuspension events. Even though Cr is affected by the same processes, it is available as Cr(III) and does not represent any ecological risk in the study areas. Although the areas under study are affected by variations in physical and chemical conditions, shipyards were effectively hotspots of trace metals in their labile fraction in various estuarine systems in southeastern and southern Brazil. Thus, they represent areas where Ecological Risk Assessment, mainly of V, should be carried out.

A1294,"The discovery of large oil accumulations in the rift and sag Pre-Salt sections of the Campos and Santos Basins has revived interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins. More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins.

B2048,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Species structure of highly productive sea areas Many human activities have been documented to have impacts on marine life living on the seabed (benthic communities). The adverse effects of mobile bottom-contacting fishing gear on coastal and shelf benthic communities have been documented essentially everywhere that such gear has been used. Bottom trawling has caused the destruction of a number of long-lived cold-water coral and sponge communities that are unlikely to recover before at least a century. Many reviews show that, locally, the nature of those impacts and their duration depend on the type of substrate and frequency of trawling. Those effects have been found in all the regional assessments. With regard to fish and pelagic invertebrate communities, much effort has been devoted to teasing apart the influences of exploitation and of environmental conditions as drivers of change in fish populations and communities, but definitive answers are elusive. Most studies devote attention to explaining variation among coastal fishcommunity properties in terms of features of the physical and chemical habitats (including temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient levels, clarity of, and pollutants in, the water column) and of depth, sediment types, benthic communities, contaminant levels, oxygen levels and disturbance of the sea floor. All of those factors have been shown to influence fish-community composition and structure in at least some coastal areas of each ocean basin. The scale at which a fish-community structure is determined and its variation is documented can be even more local, because some important drivers of change in coastal fish communities are themselves very local in scale, such as coastal infrastructure development. Other obvious patterns are recurrent, such as increasing mortality rates (whether from exploitation or coastal pollution) leading both to fish communities with fewer large fish and to an increase in species with naturally high turnover rates.

Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Species structure of highly productive sea areas Many human activities have been documented to have impacts on marine life living on the seabed (benthic communities). The adverse effects of mobile bottom-contacting fishing gear on coastal and shelf benthic communities have been documented essentially everywhere that such gear has been used. Bottom trawling has caused the destruction of a number of long-lived cold-water coral and sponge communities that are unlikely to recover before at least a century. Many reviews show that, locally, the nature of those impacts and their duration depend on the type of substrate and frequency of trawling. Those effects have been found in all the regional assessments. With regard to fish and pelagic invertebrate communities, much effort has been devoted to teasing apart the influences of exploitation and of environmental conditions as drivers of change in fish populations and communities, but definitive answers are elusive. Most studies devote attention to explaining variation among coastal fishcommunity properties in terms of features of the physical and chemical habitats (including temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient levels, clarity of, and pollutants in, the water column) and of depth, sediment types, benthic communities, contaminant levels, oxygen levels and disturbance of the sea floor. All of those factors have been shown to influence fish-community composition and structure in at least some coastal areas of each ocean basin. The scale at which a fish-community structure is determined and its variation is documented can be even more local, because some important drivers of change in coastal fish communities are themselves very local in scale, such as coastal infrastructure development. Other obvious patterns are recurrent, such as increasing mortality rates (whether from exploitation or coastal pollution) leading both to fish communities with fewer large fish and to an increase in species with naturally high turnover rates. However, some highly publicized projections of the loss of all commercial fisheries or of all large predatory fish by the middle of the current century have not withstood critical review.

There is a tendency towards increasing damage from coastal erosion in specific locations that severely affects coastal socioeconomic activities and properties (Gopalakrishnan and others, 2016; Nguyen and others, 2018 ; Stronkhorst and others, 2018). The projection for risk and damage associated with coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation indicates that they are likely to increase in the future (Dunn and others, 2019). Ecosystem impacts from coastal erosion and changes in sedimentation can be substantial, in particular if there is a transformation from long-term accretion to erosion. Coastal wetlands are at significant risk, as many of them were developed during the relative mean sea level standstill of the late Holocene (Jones and others, 2019) and may not keep up with the rising seas in the future (Myers and others, 2019). Other geomorphic features sensitive to changing patterns of erosion and sedimentation include mangrove coasts, barrier coasts and small islands. There is a high risk of ecological disturbance for organisms that exclusively use the coastal zone for nesting or nurseries, with increased proliferation of human-occupied and modified shorelines also reducing the overall bioproductivity of the coastal zone (Rangel-Buitrago and others, 2018b).

B2198,"Some key alterations are anticipated in the hydrological cycle due to global warming and climate change. Changes that have been identified include shifts in the seasonal distribution and amount of precipitation, an increase in extreme precipitation events, changes in the balance between snow and rain, accelerated melting of glacial ice, and of course sea-level rise. Although a global phenomenon, it is the impact of sea-level rise along the world’s coastlines that has major societal implications. The impacts of these changes are discussed in the next Section. Changes in the rates of freshwater exchange between the ocean, atmosphere and continents have additional significant impacts. For example, spatial variations in the distribution of evaporation and precipitation create gradients in salinity and heat that in turn drive ocean circulation; ocean freshening also affects ecosystem structure. These aspects and their impacts are discussed in Sections 3 and 4. Another factor potentially contributing to regional changes in the hydrological cycle are changes in ocean surface currents. For example, the warm surface temperatures of the large surface currents flowing at the western boundaries of the ocean basins (the Agulhas, Brazil, East Australian, Gulf Stream, and Kuroshio Currents) provide significant amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, with a profound impact on the regional hydrological cycle (e.g., Rouault et al., 2002). Ocean surface currents like these are forced by atmospheric winds and sensitive to changes in them - stronger winds can mean stronger currents and an intensification of their effects (WGII AR5 30.3.1, HoeghGuldberg, 2014), as well as faster evaporation rates. Shifts in the location of winds can also alter these currents, for example causing the transport of anomalously warm waters (e.g., Rouault, 2009). However, despite a well-documented increase in global wind speeds in the 1990s (Yu, 2007), the overall effect of climate change on winds is complex, and difficult to differentiate observationally from decadal-scale variability, and thus the ultimate effects of these currents on the hydrological cycle are difficult to predict with any high degree of confidence (WGII AR5 30.3.1, Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014).

A1574,"Currently, low oil prices pose a challenge to the financial state of the industry. Therefore, it is very important that companies optimize costs while maintaining or even increasing oil production. At the same time, with oil production declining due high water cuts and facility volume limitations in an offshore production system, it is necessary to look for solutions in order to maintain economic viability by increasing oil recovery in mature reservoirs. Among some alternatives, the subsea separator represents a good prospect for dealing with these challenges. This paper aims to describe a methodology to perform the technical feasibility study of deploying an Oil/Water Subsea Separator in Brazilian Offshore Field. The technical results were then used as part of an economic analysis which is outside the scope of the present paper. The study is comprised four wells that are linked to the manifold and the subsea separator. In the subsea separator, 70% of the produced water is separated and reinjected in a disposal well. Hence, the fluids which remains (oil, gas and 30% of water) flows up to the platform.

Currently, low oil prices pose a challenge to the financial state of the industry. Therefore, it is very important that companies optimize costs while maintaining or even increasing oil production. At the same time, with oil production declining due high water cuts and facility volume limitations in an offshore production system, it is necessary to look for solutions in order to maintain economic viability by increasing oil recovery in mature reservoirs. Among some alternatives, the subsea separator represents a good prospect for dealing with these challenges. This paper aims to describe a methodology to perform the technical feasibility study of deploying an Oil/Water Subsea Separator in Brazilian Offshore Field. The technical results were then used as part of an economic analysis which is outside the scope of the present paper. The study is comprised four wells that are linked to the manifold and the subsea separator. In the subsea separator, 70% of the produced water is separated and reinjected in a disposal well. Hence, the fluids which remains (oil, gas and 30% of water) flows up to the platform. Since this reinjected water volume is not flowing to the platform anymore, more fluid can be processed, allowing the wells to operate on larger potentials resulting in an increased cumulative oil production to the field.

A610,"In the 90's, after success in drilling wells deeper than 5,000 meters with high production rates between 80 to 120 MMSCFD of production, Petrobras decided to continuously measure pressure on their high productivity wells (7"" production tubing) because of the difficulty they experienced when running gauges in the production mode after the wells were completed. Therefore, the decision was made to use permanent electronic gauges to obtain downhole pressure as it was a proven technology and optical sensing technology (fiber optics) was new to the industry.

These Pre-Salt discoveries are remotely located at water depths ranging from 2200m (~7,200 ft) to 2600 m (~8,500 ft). Offshore Brazil has unique metocean conditions with long swell periods which present challenges on floating platforms such as Spars and Semis.

A1295,"The discovery of large oil accumulations in the rift and sag Pre-Salt sections of the Campos and Santos Basins has revived interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins. More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins. A study integrating systematic petrography, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin. This study highlights the major primary, diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession, with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones, syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite, and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites. Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits. In the sag phase, stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites, which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits. In the rift section, stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites. Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution. Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution, neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift, as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites, silica and dolomite in the sag section. Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal fluids carried through faults and fracture systems. These fluids promote dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution at varying degrees and intensities. Eodiagenetic precipitation and dissolution owing to variations in the lake water chemistry and the episodic flow of hydrothermal fluids under burial conditions control the creation, redistribution, and obliteration of porosity in the Pre-Salt reservoirs.

A study integrating systematic petrography, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin. This study highlights the major primary, diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession, with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones, syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite, and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites. Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits. In the sag phase, stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites, which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits. In the rift section, stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites. Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution. Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution, neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift, as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites, silica and dolomite in the sag section. Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal fluids carried through faults and fracture systems. These fluids promote dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution at varying degrees and intensities. Eodiagenetic precipitation and dissolution owing to variations in the lake water chemistry and the episodic flow of hydrothermal fluids under burial conditions control the creation, redistribution, and obliteration of porosity in the Pre-Salt reservoirs.

A1589,"Passive margins underlain by a salt detachment are typically interpreted as kinematically linked zones of updip extension and downdip contraction separated by a zone of translation above a smoothly dipping base of salt. However, salt flow is affected by the base-of-salt geometry across which it flows, and early-stage gravity gliding induced by basin tilt may be complicated by the presence of salt-thickness changes caused by the pre-existing base-salt relief. We investigate these effects using physical models. Dip-parallel steps generate strike-slip fault zones separating domains of differential downslope translation and structural styles, provided the overburden is thin enough. If the overburden is thicker, it resists breakup, but a change in the structural trend occurs across the step. Steps with mild obliquity to the dip direction produce transtensional and transpressional faults in the cover separating structural domains. Deformation complexity in the overburden increases where base-salt steps strike at a high angle to salt flow, and it is especially dependent on the ratio between the thick (T) and thin (t) salt across the step at the base of salt. Where the salt-thickness ratio (T/t) is high, basal drag generates major flux mismatches, resulting in a contractional thickening of the salt and associated overburden shortening in thin salt above a base-salt high block. Shortening is transient and superseded by extension as the salt thickening allows the flow velocity to increase. When transitioning off a base-salt high block into a low block, the greater flux within the thick salt results in a monocline with extensional and contractional hinges. Structures are further deformed as they translate through these hinge zones. Our physical models demonstrate that extensional diapirs and compressional fold belts can be initiated anywhere on a slope as the salt accelerates and decelerates across base-salt relief.

A346,"The rupture of a pipeline transporting hydrocarbons at high temperature caused the spill of 1,300 m3 of fuel oil near the Guanabara Bay shoreline, on January 18, 2000. Immediately after the accident, an emergency effort was undertaken to obtain satellite images in order to monitor the spill's location and movement. One Landsat-5/TM (Thematic Mapper) and 15 Radarsat-1 images were acquired. This paper describes the results obtained with the interpretation of the first three images acquired after the spill. The low frequency of acquisition and the prevailing cloud cover limited the use of visible and infrared spaceborne sensors. Image processing techniques were applied to highlight oil-covered areas on the water surface. Ambiguities in the oil detection were resolved with the aid of ancillary information such as location of knows sources of pollution; aerial inspection information and OPS controlled aerial photos taken from helicopters. The RADARSAT-1 images show clearly the area affected by the spill accident allowing the differentiation of oil-free water areas, fluvial discharge or effluents areas, and oil-covered water areas. One limitation to oil detection using the Landsat-5/TM image was the presence of clouds and haze near the spilled area. In order to improve the visual discrimination of patterns on the water surface related to oil, many RGB combinations of the seven TM bands were evaluated. A supervised classification procedure was applied resulting in the following classes: oil-free water, fluvial discharge, bay areas affected by haze and oil-covered water.

A1952,"Given the importance of copepods in pelagic food webs, short- and medium-scale temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of copepods of the genus Pseudodiaptomus was investigated in an oligo-mesohaline estuary (Paracauari) in northern Brazil. This system is characterized by high local hydrodynamics and nutrient input from the Paracauari River and Marajo Bay, and marked seasonal variation in rainfall levels. The temporal variation in the abundance of copepods was analyzed in the context of some hydrological variables tide height, salinity, temperature, pH, and concentrations of suspended particulate material, dissolved oxygen and chlorophylla. Samples were collected in 2009 at a fixed station (00° 44'15.4 '' S, 48° 31'07.5 '' W) every 3 hours during a nycthemeral cycle in the neap and spring tides of February, May, June, August, November, and December. Zooplankton samples were collected using horizontal hauls of plankton nets with a 120 pm mesh. Following identification, the abundance and density of Pseudodiaptomus copepods were determined. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA (to assess the significance of diurnal, fortnightly and seasonal variations), PCA, and Bray-Curtis similarity. Four species were identified: Pseudodiaptomus richardi, Pseudodiaptomus marshi, Pseudodiaptomus gracilis, and Pseudodiaptomus acutus. The results indicate that variation in composition and density of the Pseudodiaptomidae copepods in the Paracauari estuary is determined by the interactive effect of the freshwater influx from Marajo Bay, tides, and the rainfall regimen, which modulate local salinity.

Four species were identified: Pseudodiaptomus richardi, Pseudodiaptomus marshi, Pseudodiaptomus gracilis, and Pseudodiaptomus acutus. The results indicate that variation in composition and density of the Pseudodiaptomidae copepods in the Paracauari estuary is determined by the interactive effect of the freshwater influx from Marajo Bay, tides, and the rainfall regimen, which modulate local salinity. The absence of diurnal variation in species composition and density was determined by the high local hydrodynamics, which provoke the constant mixing of the estuary's water.

A516,"In what is being called the first oil and gas sustainable commissioning project, composite abrasives are being used to help conserve precious resources. The core of this sustainable solution includes composite abrasives and an innovative Pipeline Inspection Gauge/Gadget (or pig) system, which were first field tested and then used in Petrobras Refinaria Abreu de Lima, also known as Refinaria do Nordeste (RNEST), in Brazil. This paper focuses on the commissioning of two atmospheric distillation units (ADUs) at RNEST; ADU 11 and ADU 12. During the commissioning process, residual products in pipelines are removed (1) to assure efficient flow though refinery systems and (2) to protect operating equipment. Traditional methods of pipeline cleaning during commissioning typically include cleaning with water, chemical cleaning or steam cleaning. Each of these methods use a high volume of water, produce a high volume of wastewater discharge to be treated, and some have inherent risks to commissioning personnel and/or the environment. Because no water was used during the composite abrasive blasting at RNEST, all water-related steps (e.g. conditioning, drying, special treatment, disposal and storage/disposal) were eliminated. Thus, the number of steps in the cleaning process dropped to four: (1) abrasive blasting pipe internals and (2) applying the appropriate treatment via pig, (3) hydrostatic testing and (4) water treatment/recycling. Using data from the RNEST sustainable commissioning process, this paper will compare common cleaning operations to the new sustasinable commisioning method. Results convey that sustainable commissioning at RNEST used 300,000 liters of reusable water per atmospheric distillation unit versus more than 30 million liters per unit that would have been used with tradtional methods. (This value is estimated based on the RNEST project). In addition to conserving water, sustainable commissioning at RNEST also significantly reduced the time and monetary impact of the commissioning process.

Other characteristics are: high safety, high quality and efficiency; logistics applications with optimized use of all modes of transport, the so-called integrated co-modality, concentration of domestic and international traffic of goods on long transportation routes, efficient and strategic points of transshipment, supportive infrastructure and a platform for development and demonstration of innovative logistics solutions which includes information systems, collaborative models and technology. The green corridor project promotes collaboration between modes of transportation and their logistically optimized use, including transport nodes (hubs, docks, etc.). It can be either a national or cross-border and corridor. This paper will examine a transportation in Brazil, focusing on short sea shipping, aiming to study the importance of an integrated and sustainable logistics system in a country of continental dimensions.

B2536,"Higher mortality and less successful reproduction of marine biotas Captures of fish stocks at levels above maximum sustainable yield Globally, the levels of capture fisheries are near the ocean’s productive capacity, with catches on the order of 80 million tons.

The most commonly valued services are tourism and recreation, as well as storm protection (Mehvar and others, 2018). Fisheries alone provide multiple benefits to millions of people, including those living in poverty in the coastal communities of low-income countries. Fishes and other seafood are a major source of food, protein and micronutrients for many vulnerable communities.

The results are shown in both gathers and stacked migrated sections with improvements in the flattening and the focusing of target reflectors. This approach can also be extended to generate an input velocity model for FWI migration process.

Such innovations have led to both positive and negative outcomes for the marine environment. Some advances in fishing technologies have led to an overall increase in capacity and, in many regions in Asia, Europe and North America, to overcapacity (Eigaard and others, 2014). Increased efficiencies generated through the use of technologies (also known as “technological creep”), for example, allowing for more efficient and accurate targeting of catches, have also resulted in effort gains within fisheries, thus contributing to overfishing of stocks (Finkbeiner and others, 2017). Conversely, advances in remote sensing, camera technologies, field deployment of genetic approaches to species identification and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches are now contributing to better monitoring of illegal, unregulated and unreported catches (Detsis and others, 2012), improving the reporting of catches (Ruiz and others, 2014), allowing for the traceability of products (Lewis and Boyle, 2017) and reducing wastage along supply chains (Hafliðason and others, 2012).

A1937,"This paper describes the carbonate–siliciclastic system of the equatorial continental shelf of NE Brazil (East Ceará) based on X-ray fluorescence (XRF), grain size, CaCO3, shallow seismic and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) analyses. Data were obtained for two sectors: 1) Halimeda Bank (HB), inner shelf (−12 m), and 2) transverse profile (TP), inner to outer shelf-upper slope (−5 to −100 m). In total, 72 samples were collected, and 29 km of seismic lines (HB) and ROV profiles (HB and TP) were surveyed. The main chemical elements were Ca and Si (93%). These elements occur in two types of shallow marine sediments: carbonate (mainly autochthonous) and siliciclastics (terrigenous/allochthonous/relict). With respect to the chemical elements, a strong negative correlation was observed between calcareous (Ca and Sr) and siliciclastic (Si, Al, and K) components. Strontium does not always show a strong positive correlation with Ca. The average CaCO3 contents of 81% and 91% were determined for the HB and TP, respectively. The profiles show a predominance of carbonate sediments; however, the HB demonstrates a greater continental influence (inner shelf). The grain size presents a prevalence of sand (82%) in relation to gravel (18%). This particle size variation is mainly due to the breakdown of Halimeda nodules, siliciclastic sediments in the finer fraction (>2.5Φ), and the presence of gravel with iron coating (relict).

A1132,"Drilling salt zones, especially in deep and ultra-deep waters, presents several challenges to be overcome. One of the main problems faced by drilling engineers while designing and executing a section in salt zones, is the formation flow to the wellbore. Temperature and pressure exerted by the rocks above the salt formation make it have a plastic behavior that tend to flow, and close the wellbore caliper as the bit drills it. The deeper the salt formation, the higher the temperature and pressure above it and, consequently, the higher the tendency to flow to the well, causing several problems, such as high torque, drag and stuckpipes. In order to avoid these problems and to keep the wellbore stable, the drilling fluid must exert a minimum hydrostatic pressure on the formation. Thus, the mud weight is a very important parameter that needs to be determined with a good precision. Since there are no reliable tools to help drilling designers to predict the mud weight based on the wellbore information and its lithology, this is a very difficult task. Nowadays, the prediction of mud weights for pre-salt wells is made based on the designer experience and it's updated during the drilling job as the engineers analyze the wellbore behavior.

Metal prices are difficult to predict, which can create significant risk that may delay commercial mining. Deepwater seabed mineral resources are typically located far from human communities and the social impacts of their exploitation may be less than those of terrestrial mining. However, significant concerns exist about loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, including the role of the deep ocean in climate regulation. Those legitimate concerns constitute the basis for a “social licence to operate”.

B1994,"Scale and distribution of tourism Tourism affecting the ocean, other than cruising, is predominantly located in the coastal zone. Statistics are not available globally to show the scale of tourism in the coastal zone. Because of their geography, some countries with large tourism industries, such as Greece, inevitably have a very large proportion of that industry in coastal areas. Elsewhere, evidence from different regions of the world continues to show that coastal tourism remains a major component of overall tourism. For example, in addition to the evidence quoted in the first Assessment: In the countries of the European Union, four of the five regions with the highest levels of tourist activity in 2016 (Canary Islands, Catalonia, Adriatic Croatia and Balearic Islands) were coastal regions (the other region was Île-de-France, around Paris) (European Commission, 2018); The percentage of tourists in the Republic of Korea who visited the coastal zone increased from 49.5 per cent in 2000 to 69.1 per cent in 2010, and the total number of beach visitors in 2014 was 69 million (Chang and Yoon, 2017); Destinations in the four coastal provinces of Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa accounted for 28 per cent of the total tourism trips and 40 per cent of total tourism spending in 2015. Overall, coastal destinations were dominated substantially by domestic tourists: 9.8 million domestic tourism trips as compared with 1.6 million international tourist trips; tourism activity is particularly concentrated around Cape Town and in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality (which includes Durban), which in 2015 together accounted for 75 per cent of total tourism spending in South African coastal areas (Rogerson and Rogerson, 2018, 2019). International travel and associated tourism play a major role in many parts of the world, in particular in the “sun, sea and sand” type of tourism. The relatively rapid rate of growth in international travel observed in the first Assessment continued throughout the 2010s (table 3) and between 2011 and 2017. Throughout the world as a whole, the rate of growth in the numbers of international tourists continued between 2011 and 2017 at above the longterm rate, reaching an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, slightly higher than that reported in the first Assessment. The estimated income derived from international tourism has continued to grow globally, at an annual average rate of 4.0 per cent, but not in line with the number of tourists. That implies that, on average, tourists are spending less. However, the global growth in tourist numbers is sufficient to more than offset the decline, and the share of tourism in export earnings globally has continued to increase (World Bank, 2019). Global patterns in numbers of tourists and expenditure vary significantly between regions (table 4). The absolute scale of tourism in different regions also varies significantly. Collectively, some of the countries in South Asia and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar and Pakistan) achieved a 119 per cent increase in inbound international tourist numbers between 2011 and 2017 (although from a relatively low base), far outstripping other regions. Other regions have, in general, experienced growth rates of less than 10 per cent (table 4). Nevertheless, Caribbean States, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, have had growth rates of around 25 per cent, well above the regional average (World Bank, 2019). The Middle East and North Africa has experienced relatively low growth in tourist numbers, but a substantial growth in tourist income, suggesting that the tourist industry is offering more upmarket experiences (World Bank, 2019).

In 2012, international tourism expenditure exceeded 1 billion dollars for the first time. Total expenditure on tourism, domestic as well as international, is several times that amount. The direct turnover of tourism contributed 2.9 per cent of gross world product in 2013, rising to 8.9 per cent when the multiplier effect on the rest of the economy is taken into account. The Middle East is the region where tourism plays the smallest part in the economy (6.4 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect), and the Caribbean is the region where it plays the largest part (13.9 per cent of GDP, including the multiplier effect). Most reports of tourism revenues do not differentiate revenues from tourism directly related to the sea and the coast from other types of tourism. Even where tourism in the coastal zone can be separated from tourism inland, it may be generated by the attractions of the sea and coast or its maritime history, as it may be based on other attractions not linked to the marine environment. Consequently, the value of ocean-related tourism is a matter of inference. However, coastal tourism is a major component of tourism everywhere. In small island and coastal States, coastal tourism is usually predominant because it can only take place in the coastal zone in those countries. Particularly noteworthy is the way in which international tourism is increasing in Asia and the Pacific, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of world tourism.

A1951,"Given the importance of copepods in pelagic food webs, short- and medium-scale temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of copepods of the genus Pseudodiaptomus was investigated in an oligo-mesohaline estuary (Paracauari) in northern Brazil. This system is characterized by high local hydrodynamics and nutrient input from the Paracauari River and Marajo Bay, and marked seasonal variation in rainfall levels. The temporal variation in the abundance of copepods was analyzed in the context of some hydrological variables tide height, salinity, temperature, pH, and concentrations of suspended particulate material, dissolved oxygen and chlorophylla. Samples were collected in 2009 at a fixed station (00° 44'15.4 '' S, 48° 31'07.5 '' W) every 3 hours during a nycthemeral cycle in the neap and spring tides of February, May, June, August, November, and December. Zooplankton samples were collected using horizontal hauls of plankton nets with a 120 pm mesh. Following identification, the abundance and density of Pseudodiaptomus copepods were determined. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA (to assess the significance of diurnal, fortnightly and seasonal variations), PCA, and Bray-Curtis similarity. Four species were identified: Pseudodiaptomus richardi, Pseudodiaptomus marshi, Pseudodiaptomus gracilis, and Pseudodiaptomus acutus. The results indicate that variation in composition and density of the Pseudodiaptomidae copepods in the Paracauari estuary is determined by the interactive effect of the freshwater influx from Marajo Bay, tides, and the rainfall regimen, which modulate local salinity.

A1395,"Lipid biomarkers [fatty acids (FAs), sterols and alcohols] and carbon stable isotopes (δ¹³C values) in surface sediments from 9 cross shelf transects (25–3000 m water depth) from the Campos Basin, SE Brazilian continental margin were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the link between the prevailing regional specific oceanographic conditions (upwelling events, intrusion of cold and nutrient-rich water, low river input) and the nature and distribution of organic matter (OM) in the basin. A general predominance of OM from autochthonous processes, but with a relevant spatial gradient in the quality and quantity of the sedimentary OM, was observed. On the shelf (<150 m), concentrations of lipids were usually low, except in areas influenced by upwelling, but the presence of labile compounds suggested the occurrence of fresh OM in the sediment. The export of continental OM was observed only in shelf sediments near the Paraíba do Sul River. The upper and middle slope (400–1300 m) exhibited the highest concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and lipids, but lipid biomarkers suggested the presence of OM with a high degree of bacterial degradation. This may result from the export of material from shallow areas, possibly due to the action of eddies and meandering of the Brazil Current and bottom currents in the region. On the lower slope (1900–3000 m), only the more recalcitrant compounds were above detection limit. The presence of labile lipids in high amount in the shelf and slope suggests the presence of OM with a high potential for supplying the food requirements of heterotrophic organisms in the sediment, which may in turn have a major influence on the ecology of benthic communities.

The upper and middle slope (400–1300 m) exhibited the highest concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and lipids, but lipid biomarkers suggested the presence of OM with a high degree of bacterial degradation. This may result from the export of material from shallow areas, possibly due to the action of eddies and meandering of the Brazil Current and bottom currents in the region. On the lower slope (1900–3000 m), only the more recalcitrant compounds were above detection limit. The presence of labile lipids in high amount in the shelf and slope suggests the presence of OM with a high potential for supplying the food requirements of heterotrophic organisms in the sediment, which may in turn have a major influence on the ecology of benthic communities.

Therefore, we intend to clarify the extent to which Brazilian law ""protects"" the exploitation of natural resources, especially hydrocarbons, from a coastal environment approach.

For officers, China was reported to be the largest supplier, followed by the Philippines, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation. For ratings, the Philippines was the largest supplier, followed by China, Indonesia, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

In 2003, the production was 1.54 million bpd avg. The decline in production was due to delays in construction and the arrival of two Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels, the P-43 and P-48. The P-43 began to process crude oil on 12/22/2004. When the P-48 enters service, Petrobras will be able to increase its production of crude oil by 500,000 bpd. The P-43 is stationed in the Barracuda field, bay of Campos, offshore the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 800 m of water. Initial oil yield is 10,380 bpd of 25° gravity. Platform P-48, the twin of P-43, is part of the Barracuda-Caratinga project that will increase Petrobras crude oil production by 300,000 bpd. This platform will enter service in January 2005. With the new capacity, the production of crude oil by Petrobras is expected to reach 1.9 million bpd by the end of 2005. Other floating installations will contribute as well when they enter service, the P-50 and P-34. Petrobras is to invest $26,200 million until 2010 for E&P. Between 2005 and 2008, 17 installations will enter service allowing annual increases of 5.9% in production of crude oil and NGL, achieving self sufficiency in 2006. Petrobras has invested heavily in improved recovery that in the last 10 yr in the Marlim oilfield has yielded an additional increment of 3000 million bbl of crude oil. In November 2004 Petrobras gave a $47 million contract to the Western Geco company to make a three dimensional seismic study of the Marlim basin to identify reserves there. Discovery of an additional 290 million bbl of crude oil in Marlim is expected. On dry land, improved recovery enabled an increment of 200,000 bpd in production from the fields in the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe in 2004.

Earlier and higher oil production from those oil fields could be attained by the use of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP), so far restricted to dry completions. Also longer distances from well to platform would be made practical. For the initial phase of this development, Petrobras worked together with Tronic, Reda, Pirelli, Lasalle, Sade-Vigesa and Cooper.

As offshore oil fields are being developed towards deeper and deeper waters, new technologies are required to curb capital expenditures. In Brazil, where oil consumption is increasing and huge oil fields lie in high water depths, the issue is particularly pressing. Earlier and higher oil production from those oil fields could be attained by the use of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP), so far restricted to dry completions. Also longer distances from well to platform would be made practical. For the initial phase of this development, Petrobras worked together with Tronic, Reda, Pirelli, Lasalle, Sade-Vigesa and Cooper. As a result, first-in-the-world ESP installation in a subsea well has been successfully achieved on October/1994 in RJS-221, located at Carapeba Field, Campos Basin, Brazil.

B2559,"Patterns of biodiversity Location of biodiversity hotspots and their relationship to the location of high levels of ecosystem services Although marine life is found everywhere in the ocean, biodiversity hotspots exist where the number of species and the concentration of biotas are consistently high relative to adjacent areas. Some are subregional, such as the coral triangle in the IndoPacific, the coral reefs in the Caribbean, the cold-water corals in the Mediterranean and the Sargasso Sea. Some are more local and associated with specific physical conditions, such as biodiversity-rich habitat types. Key drivers of biodiversity are complex threedimensional physical structures that create a diversity of physical habitats (associated with rocky sea floors), dynamic oceanographic conditions causing higher bottom-up productivity, effects of land-based inputs extending far out to sea (such as the inputs from the River Amazon) and special vegetation features creating unique and productive habitats near the shore. Those complex habitats, however, are often highly vulnerable to disturbance. The high relative and absolute biodiversity of those hotspots often directly supports the extractive benefits of fishing and other harvests, providing a direct link between biodiversity and the provision of services by the ocean. The areas supporting high relative and absolute levels of biodiversity not only harbour unique species adapted to their special features, but also often serve as centres for essential life-history stages of species with wider distributions. For example, essentially all the biodiversity hotspots that have been identified have also been found to harbour juvenile fish, which are important for fisheries in adjacent areas.

B2287,"The global biomass of marine fishes is approximately four times the total biomass of all birds and mammals (Bar-On and others, 2018), and fishes constitute an important part of marine biodiversity. Approximately 70 per cent of the marine fish biomass is comprised of mesopelagic fishes, although with wide estimate ranges, found in depths of 200–1,000 m (Irigoien and others, 2014, Hidalgo and Browman, 2019). Fishes occur throughout the world’s oceans and in a wide range of depths. For example, the fish seen alive at the greatest depth is the snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei, formally described in 2017 and found in depths greater than 8,000 m in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean (Linley and others, 2016, Gerringer and others, 2017). Fishes play a key role in marine food webs as both predators and prey, often moving through food webs over the course of their lifetimes, such as from planktonic larvae into predatory adults. Fish biodiversity varies between habitats. Habitat affiliations in the Fishbase biodiversity information system for 17,246 species (97 per cent of all known species) show that most bony fishes are demersal or reef-associated, while most species of sharks and rays, chimaeras and coelacanths are demersal or bathydemersal (see table 1). Fish biodiversity is changing, and fishes are sensitive to environmental changes caused by multiple external pressures (Comte and Olden, 2017) and to exploitation by fisheries (see chap. 15), which has important implications for human well-being (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2018). The first Assessment included chapters on the conservation challenges faced by the 1,088 species of sharks and other elasmobranchs (United Nations, 2017c) and the 25 species of tunas and billfishes (United Nations, 2017d). In addition, overall synthesis chapters revealed that fishes were among the best-known marine groups (United Nations, 2017a, b), with clear latitudinal and depth gradients in diversity. The mechanisms driving fish diversity are complex and include ecosystem stability and age, niche partitioning and predator-mediated dampening of dominance (Rabosky and others, 2018). Overexploitation and habitat loss and degradation were recently identified as major threats to marine fish biodiversity, and while the impacts of climate change have become more apparent, pollution was not considered a significant threat (Arthington and others, 2016). Subsequently, evidence has emerged that scientific assessment and effective fisheries management can reverse the effects of overexploitation, leading to increases in abundance on average for well-managed stocks constituting half of the reported global fish catch, although overexploitation remains a significant threat in regions with less-developed fisheries management (Hilborn and others, 2020). The impacts of climate change and thermal stress on marine fishes, in particular coral reef fish communities, have become more severe (Robinson and others, 2019), while novel threats, for instance microplastic pollution, are now also attracting increased research interest, even though considerable uncertainty remains about their population-level effects (Villarrubia-Gómez and others, 2018).

B2083,"Advances in knowledge and capacity New exploration and development in offshore areas remain a major source of increasing global oil and gas production. Technological advances in the past decade have encouraged exploration in deep and ultradeep waters further away from shore and enabled the discovery of significant new reserves. The water depth capabilities for offshore exploration increased from about 3,050 m to more than 3,350 m between 2010 and 2018, while production capability using floating platforms reached almost 2,900 m in 2018, up from 2,438 m in 2010 (Barton and others, 2019). Such technological advances have in part enabled the expansion of the offshore oil and gas sector to new regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and areas off the coast of Guyana. There have also been advances in understanding the potential environmental and social impacts of exploration and production activities on the surrounding environment and in the development of new approaches to mitigate impacts. For example, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has created a Marine Noise Registry to record human activities that produce loud impulsive noise (10 Hz– 10 kHz) in the seas around its territory. This initiative intends to create baseline data and to quantify the pressure on the environment from anthropogenic activities associated with hydrocarbon exploration and development, including seismic surveys, sub-bottom profiling and pile driving.

A521,"Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil.

Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil.

B2353,"Ocean warming and land ice melt are the main causes of present-day accelerating global mean sea level rise. The global mean sea level has been rising since 1993 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with a clear superimposed acceleration of approximately 0.1 mm per year. Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions. Owing to global warming, many circulation systems also experience changes. Changes in sea level height, measured with high-precision satellite altimetry, hint at the widening and strengthening of the subtropical gyres in the North and South Pacific. The studies, furthermore, show a poleward movement of many ocean currents, including the Antarctic circumpolar current and the subtropical gyres in the southern hemisphere, as well as western boundary currents in all ocean basins. One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future. Impacts that follow such changes include regional sea level rise, changes in nutrient distribution and carbon uptake and feedbacks with the atmosphere. The globally averaged ocean surface temperature data show a warming of 0.62±0.12?°C per century over the period 1900– 2018. In the recent decade (2009–2018), the rate of ocean surface warming is 2.56±0.68?°C c-1. The warming happens in most ocean regions with some areas, such as in the North Atlantic, showing long-term cooling. Since 1955, the upper 2,000 m of the ocean has also exhibited signs of robust warming, as evidenced by the increase in ocean heat content.

B2227,"The marine environment is currently subject to a number of pressures, many of which are derived from human activities. They include climate change, the extraction of resources, pollution (from land and marine sources) and invasive species, resulting in biodiversity loss, habitat damage and fragmentation and disease (e.g., Evans and others, 2017). The aim of ecosystem-based management is to balance human activities with environmental stewardship in order to maintain ecosystem properties, functions and services. That requires an appreciation of how and to what extent human activities and natural events interact and affect ecosystem components and their functioning. It also requires the identification of solutions to prevent and mitigate the pressures being caused by such interactions (Halpern and others, 2008; Levin and others, 2009; Ban and others, 2010; Curtin and Prellezo, 2010). Those interactions are known as cumulative impacts or cumulative effects. The terms “cumulative impacts” and “cumulative effects” are often used interchangeably to describe how pressures affect ecosystems. The use of standardized language is key to the transfer of knowledge, assessment approaches and expertise across management boundaries and among stakeholders and organizations. A preference for the use of the term “cumulative effects” has been identified, noting that impacts are hypothesized and have been either not directly observed or attributed (Murray and others, 2015). For consistency, the term “cumulative effects” is used in the present chapter. There is as yet no universally accepted definition of cumulative effects and impacts, with definitions varying in the literature, depending on what is being assessed, and the context within which the assessment is being undertaken (e.g., Anthony, 2016; Spaling and Smit, 1993; Hegmann and others, 1999; Halpern and others, 2008; Johnson, 2016; Uthicke and others, 2016). The present chapter follows the premise that effects can be defined as a change to the environment, including its human components, while impacts represent the consequences of such change (Johnson, 2016). There are four general types of cumulative effects: additive, synergistic, antagonistic (compensatory) and masking (Sonntag and others, 1987; Hegmann and others, 1999; Crain and others, 2008; Halpern and others, 2008). Additive effects are incremental additions to the pressures caused by an activity, with each increment adding to previous increments over time. Synergistic effects, also referred to as amplifying or exponential effects, magnify the consequences of individual pressures to produce a joint consequence that is greater than the additive effect. Antagonistic or compensatory effects produce a joint consequence that is less than additive. Masking effects produce essentially the same consequence for the ecosystem or social component as would occur with exposure to one of the pressures alone. Impacts that can be considered cumulative may result from a single activity that repeatedly produces a single pressure, a single activity that produces multiple pressures, multiple activities that produce a single pressure or multiple activities that produce multiple pressures over time (Foley and others, 2017).

A250,"Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree.

A1478,"The Pará-Maranhão/Barreirinhas margin, North Brazil, is a pull-apart passive margin, with two strike-slip borders, formed during the opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean during Cretaceous time. Its geometry and evolution are speculative due to the lack of information on the crustal structure and the crustal nature. We present here the E-W profiles of the MAGIC (Margins of brAzil, Ghana and Ivory Coast) deep seismic experiment, a joint project between French and Brazilian universities, research institutes and the industry. Fifty-six Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and a 4.5 seismic streamer were deployed at sea along 2 of the 5 MAGIC profiles. One profile was extended onshore by installing 8 land stations. We perform forward modelling through combined interpretation of the multichannel seismic and of the main reflected and refracted of these phases recorded by the OBSs. The final P-wave velocity models reveal distinct structural domains from onshore Brazil towards the Atlantic Ocean characterized by variations of the crustal thicknesses and velocities: (1) an unthinned continental crust below the São Luís Craton, where the crust is 33 km thick, (2) a 60 km wide necking domain below the Ilha de Santana Platform; (3) offshore, east of the continental slope, a 10 km-thick deep sedimentary basin underlain by a 5 km thick crust with velocity of 6.2–6.9 km/s that we interpret as an exhumed lower continental crust, on the top of an Anomalous Velocity Layer (AVL) probably made of intrusions of mantle-derived melts into the lower continental crust, or a mixture of them; (4) eastwards, the limit of the previous domain is marked by NW-SE aligned volcanoes and the disappearance of the AVL. The sedimentary succession becomes thinner (6 km) overlaying a proto-oceanic crust characterized by seismic velocities higher than “normal” oceanic crust in its upper part, but in continuity with the velocity described in the previous domain; (5) followed by a more characteristic but thin oceanic crust. The middle/lower continental crust seems not only to have a crucial role in the genesis of the passive margin but also to be involved in the genesis of the first oceanic crust. The passage to a typical oceanic crust seems to have occurred progressively by steps: first in the deeper layer by the setup of more and more intrusions of mantle-derived melts at the base of the crust or mixture of exhumed lower crust and mantle, producing a domain of proto-oceanic crust, then by the emplacement of an upper 1-2 km-thick layer with typical oceanic characteristics.

The final P-wave velocity models reveal distinct structural domains from onshore Brazil towards the Atlantic Ocean characterized by variations of the crustal thicknesses and velocities: (1) an unthinned continental crust below the São Luís Craton, where the crust is 33 km thick, (2) a 60 km wide necking domain below the Ilha de Santana Platform; (3) offshore, east of the continental slope, a 10 km-thick deep sedimentary basin underlain by a 5 km thick crust with velocity of 6.2–6.9 km/s that we interpret as an exhumed lower continental crust, on the top of an Anomalous Velocity Layer (AVL) probably made of intrusions of mantle-derived melts into the lower continental crust, or a mixture of them; (4) eastwards, the limit of the previous domain is marked by NW-SE aligned volcanoes and the disappearance of the AVL. The sedimentary succession becomes thinner (6 km) overlaying a proto-oceanic crust characterized by seismic velocities higher than “normal” oceanic crust in its upper part, but in continuity with the velocity described in the previous domain; (5) followed by a more characteristic but thin oceanic crust. The middle/lower continental crust seems not only to have a crucial role in the genesis of the passive margin but also to be involved in the genesis of the first oceanic crust. The passage to a typical oceanic crust seems to have occurred progressively by steps: first in the deeper layer by the setup of more and more intrusions of mantle-derived melts at the base of the crust or mixture of exhumed lower crust and mantle, producing a domain of proto-oceanic crust, then by the emplacement of an upper 1-2 km-thick layer with typical oceanic characteristics.

A1011,"The discovery and production, by Petrobras, of over 50 billion barrels in place of pre-salt oil in Brazil's offshore South Atlantic Santos and Campos basins has drawn worldwide attention to its km-thick Cretaceous salt seal since 2007. However, the depth of the pre-salt reservoir in these basins make prohibitive the costs of continuous coring or even extensive logging of the salt. The salt seal of the Santos and Campos basins forms part of the Cretaceous South Atlantic salt giant, the largest in the world, now divided between Brazil and southwestern Africa. Although our petrographic study is concentrated north of the Santos and Campos basins, we nevertheless discuss the age, facies, tectonic-paleogeographic controls and evolution of the entire Brazilian salt giant. Offshore Brazil, salt extends for 2.200 km from the Sergipe Basin in the northeast to the Santos Basin in the southwest. The Sergipe Basin at its NE end displays the full spectrum of evaporite cycles, spanning from carbonates, anhydrites and halites to the highly soluble hydrated Mg-chlorides carnallite, bischoffite and tachyhydrite, as does the Santos Basin in the SW part of the salt giant. The deposition of Mg-chlorides was terminated in Sergipe by an intra-salt unconformity at the carnallite/sylvinite contact, dated as 110.64 ± 0.34 Ma. In the intervening Espírito Santo and Campos basins, these highly soluble salts have not yet been found. Onshore Sergipe and Espírito Santo basins the entire salt sequence has been cored in several wells, including the highly soluble Mg–K–Ca chlorides. Here, we analyze the petrography and chemistry of cores in Sergipe and Espírito Santo. We prove the presence of tachyhydrite beds at both ends of the salt giant, in the Sergipe and Santos basins, but, at least for the time being, not in between the two basins. By comparing the presence of tachyhydrite beds in Brazil with similar evaporite sequences of similar age in Thailand, we defend that the high Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios in Cretaceous seawater was the de facto cause for tachyhydrite deposition in both regions. Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios of global seawater were raised by hydrothermal activity over basalts produced at exceptionally high rates in the Aptian along new mid-oceanic ridges and in oceanic plateaus such as Ontong-Java. The heat loss caused by this exceptionally high igneous activity may have been instrumental to the change of the thermochemical conditions across the core-mantle boundary that stabilized the Cretaceous Normal Superchron for nearly 40 Ma, from 123.4 to 121.2 Ma (2σ) to 83.07 ± 0.15 Ma (2σ) Ma. Aptian volcanic activity in the South Atlantic formed the Rio Grande Rise - Walvis Ridge that was the southern barrier of the salt basin, lava flows on the São Paulo Plateau, and basalts along the developing South Atlantic Ridge. Evaporite facies reflect cyclic changes on all scales when concentrating the depositing brines. We therefore analyze the effect of increases in brine concentration on the formation of salt crystals throughout multiple depositional cycles. In the later stages of the Brazilian salt basins, increased inflow of seawater from the Central Atlantic Ocean along the Equatorial pull-apart rift basins enlarged and deepened the existent brine lake while its salinity, and especially its Ca and Mg contents, dropped. Flooding by this less concentrated brine created an unconformity, leaching Mg and Ca from the carnallite and tachyhydrite previously deposited, and replacing them with secondary sylvinite. Our results can be applied to the essentially uncored salt sequence of the Campos and Santos basins, where igneous and hydrothermal activity provided additional sources of calcium.

B2421,"Inputs and resources Land and water are the most important resources for aquaculture development. Gentry and others (2017) estimated that 11,400,000 km2 of coastline are suitable for fishes, and more than 1,500,000 km2 could be developed for bivalves. The challenge is to secure suitable land and water resources for the development of aquaculture at the national level. Good quality seeds and optimal feeds are essential. Most animal species are cultured with external feeds, and feeding the ever-expanding aquaculture sector has been a concern. In 2016, about 55.6 million tons of farmed fishes (including Indian carps) and crustaceans depended on external feeds (composed of fresh ingredients, farm-made or commercially manufactured) (FAO, 2018b). In 2005, aquaculture consumed about 4.2 million tons of fishmeal (18.5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). By 2015, this had been reduced to 3.35 million tons (7 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight). Even with increasing production globally, the use of fishmeal for aquafeeds will decrease further to 3.33 million tons by 2020 (5 per cent of total aquafeeds by weight for that year). Efforts towards making sustainable feeds by replacing fishmeal and fish oils with plant-based feed can have an impact on levels of omega-3 fatty acids and the nutritional value of farmed fishes. The industry can make strategic use of fish oils in fish feed by feeding these essential compounds to farmed fishes at key life stages. Nevertheless, for aquaculture to grow, aquafeed production is expected to continue growing at a similar rate, to 69 million tons by 2020 (Hasan, 2017). Considering past trends and predictions, aquaculture sustainability is more likely to be closely linked with the sustained supply of terrestrial animal and plant proteins, oils and carbohydrate sources for aquafeeds (Troell and others, 2014). The aquaculture sector should therefore strive to ensure sustainable supplies of terrestrial and plant-based feed ingredients, including algae and processing waste, that do not compete directly with use for feeding people directly.

A1933,"In the Peregrino field, located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil, the operator adopted the use of water-based drilling fluids for drilling development wells due to rig limitations. In the 12 ¼-in. sections of several wells drilled in this field, high dispersion of shale minerals suffered by the drilling fluid caused increments of viscosity, which subsequently affected the drilling process through higher-than-expected circulation pressures, dilution rates, and costs. Although the wells have been drilled within the estimated times and budgets, an improvement in the fluid inhibition capability was initiated. A detailed laboratory effort was conducted to obtain a combination of inhibitors capable of controlling excessive clay dispersion, minimizing fluid rock interaction, and reducing dilution requirements while helping to ensure an adequate rheological profile throughout the interval. Laboratory validation of the interaction between the fluid and rock samples provided a better understanding of the inhibition mechanisms and helped ensure that stability of the reactive minerals drilled could be maintained. Various additives were tested against samples of commercial-reactive and field-reactive clays. Product concentrations were adjusted to reduce the interaction between the drilling fluid and the formation while helping to ensure that fluid capabilities, such as cuttings suspension, filtration control, and bridging, were maintained.

B2239,"Increasing inputs of harmful material Shipping Pollution from ships takes the form of both catastrophic events (shipwrecks, collisions and groundings) and chronic pollution from regular operational discharges. Good progress has been made over the past 40 years in reducing both. There have been large increases in the global tonnage of cargo carried by sea and in the distances over which those cargoes are carried. There have also been steady increases in the number of passengers carried on cruise ships and ferries. In spite of this, the absolute number of ship losses has steadily decreased. Between 2002 and 2013, the number of losses of ships of over 1,000 gross tonnage thus dropped by 45 per cent to 94. This is largely due to efforts under the three main international maritime safety conventions: the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea,87 dealing with ship construction and navigation, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, 88 dealing with crew, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Pollution from oil has been the most significant type of marine pollution from ships. The number of spills exceeding 7 tons has dropped steadily, in spite of the growth in the quantity carried and the length of voyages, from over 100 spills in 1974 to under five in 2012. The total quantity of oil released in those spills has also been reduced by an even greater factor. Progress has also been made in improving response capabilities, though much remains to be done, especially as coastal States have to bear the capital cost of acquiring the necessary equipment. Reductions in oil pollution have resulted from more effective enforcement of the MARPOL requirements, particularly in western Europe. The changes in arrangements for reparation for any damage caused by oil pollution from ships have improved the economic position of those affected. In spite of all that progress, oil discharges from ships remain an environmental problem, for example, around the southern tip of Africa and in the North-West Atlantic. Off the coast of Argentina, however, a solution to the impact of those discharges on penguin colonies seems to have been found by rerouting coastal shipping. The likely opening of shipping routes through the Arctic between the Atlantic and the Pacific risks introducing that form of pollution into a sea area where response infrastructure is lacking, oil recovery in freezing conditions is difficult and the icy water temperature inhibits the microbial breakdown of the oil.

B2357,"Ocean warming and land ice melt are the main causes of present-day accelerating global mean sea level rise. The global mean sea level has been rising since 1993 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with a clear superimposed acceleration of approximately 0.1 mm per year. Satellite altimetry has also revealed strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change, with regional rates up to two or three times greater than the global mean in some regions. Owing to global warming, many circulation systems also experience changes. Changes in sea level height, measured with high-precision satellite altimetry, hint at the widening and strengthening of the subtropical gyres in the North and South Pacific. The studies, furthermore, show a poleward movement of many ocean currents, including the Antarctic circumpolar current and the subtropical gyres in the southern hemisphere, as well as western boundary currents in all ocean basins. One of the major ocean current systems, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has already weakened, and it is very likely that it will continue to do so in the future. Impacts that follow such changes include regional sea level rise, changes in nutrient distribution and carbon uptake and feedbacks with the atmosphere. The globally averaged ocean surface temperature data show a warming of 0.62±0.12?°C per century over the period 1900– 2018. In the recent decade (2009–2018), the rate of ocean surface warming is 2.56±0.68?°C c-1. The warming happens in most ocean regions with some areas, such as in the North Atlantic, showing long-term cooling. Since 1955, the upper 2,000 m of the ocean has also exhibited signs of robust warming, as evidenced by the increase in ocean heat content. The spatial patterns of multidecadal salinity changes provide convincing evidence of global-scale water cycle change in the global ocean coincident with warming over the period. The resolved changes are replicated in all observed analyses of long-term salinity changes, and more recently have been reproduced in forced climate model simulations. Those changes are manifested in enhanced salinities in the near-surface, high-salinity subtropical regions and corresponding freshening in the low-salinity regions such as the West Pacific Warm Pool and the poles. Similar changes are also seen in the ocean subsurface, with similar patterns of freshening low-salinity waters and enhanced high-salinity waters represented in each of the ocean basins, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian, and across the Southern Ocean.

Since 1955, the upper 2,000 m of the ocean has also exhibited signs of robust warming, as evidenced by the increase in ocean heat content. The spatial patterns of multidecadal salinity changes provide convincing evidence of global-scale water cycle change in the global ocean coincident with warming over the period. The resolved changes are replicated in all observed analyses of long-term salinity changes, and more recently have been reproduced in forced climate model simulations. Those changes are manifested in enhanced salinities in the near-surface, high-salinity subtropical regions and corresponding freshening in the low-salinity regions such as the West Pacific Warm Pool and the poles. Similar changes are also seen in the ocean subsurface, with similar patterns of freshening low-salinity waters and enhanced high-salinity waters represented in each of the ocean basins, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian, and across the Southern Ocean.

B2327,"Climate change Climate has always been a major influence on the marine environment, with high natural variability from year to year and longer-term variability associated with climate phenomena at the regional and global levels. However, there is strong evidence that the climate is changing at a rate unprecedented in the geological record. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2019), summarizes historic and recent patterns in the global climate and provides projections of changes under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise over the period since the first Assessment, with global CO2 emissions increasing from 30.4 gigatons in 2010 to 33.3 gigatons in 2019. The growth in emissions has resulted in widespread reduction of the cryosphere (frozen-water parts of the planet), continued increases in ocean temperature, decreases in ocean pH and oxygen, shifts in currents and increases in extreme events such as heatwaves (IPCC, 2019). Those changes are described in detail in chapter 5, and the pressures that they are generating, including socioeconomic impacts, are described in detail in chapter 9. Following on from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (which entered into force in 1994) and the Kyoto Protocol (which entered into force in 2005), the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, at its twenty-first session, adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015. The Agreement is aimed at strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by holding the global average temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It is recognized in the Agreement that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation of all countries. It is also recognized that deep reductions in global emissions will be required in order to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention. In its report on global warming of 1.5°C (IPCC, 2018), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined the mitigation pathways compatible with a 1.5°C warming of the global climate, likely impacts associated with such warming and what would be needed in response to such a change. It highlighted that warming from anthropogenic emissions would persist for centuries to millenniums and would continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, including the ocean. Interactions between climate change and other drivers include influencing the distribution of global populations as people shift from increasingly uninhabitable areas, economic impacts, including those associated with food production (e.g., aquaculture and fisheries), and an ever greater need for technological innovations and solutions to reduce greenhouse gases, including further reliance on marine renewable energy.

A551,"The discovery and production, by Petrobras, of over 50 billion barrels in place of pre-salt oil in Brazil's offshore South Atlantic Santos and Campos basins has drawn worldwide attention to its km-thick Cretaceous salt seal since 2007. However, the depth of the pre-salt reservoir in these basins make prohibitive the costs of continuous coring or even extensive logging of the salt. The salt seal of the Santos and Campos basins forms part of the Cretaceous South Atlantic salt giant, the largest in the world, now divided between Brazil and southwestern Africa. Although our petrographic study is concentrated north of the Santos and Campos basins, we nevertheless discuss the age, facies, tectonic-paleogeographic controls and evolution of the entire Brazilian salt giant. Offshore Brazil, salt extends for 2.200 km from the Sergipe Basin in the northeast to the Santos Basin in the southwest. The Sergipe Basin at its NE end displays the full spectrum of evaporite cycles, spanning from carbonates, anhydrites and halites to the highly soluble hydrated Mg-chlorides carnallite, bischoffite and tachyhydrite, as does the Santos Basin in the SW part of the salt giant. The deposition of Mg-chlorides was terminated in Sergipe by an intra-salt unconformity at the carnallite/sylvinite contact, dated as 110.64 ± 0.34 Ma. In the intervening Espírito Santo and Campos basins, these highly soluble salts have not yet been found. Onshore Sergipe and Espírito Santo basins the entire salt sequence has been cored in several wells, including the highly soluble Mg–K–Ca chlorides. Here, we analyze the petrography and chemistry of cores in Sergipe and Espírito Santo. We prove the presence of tachyhydrite beds at both ends of the salt giant, in the Sergipe and Santos basins, but, at least for the time being, not in between the two basins. By comparing the presence of tachyhydrite beds in Brazil with similar evaporite sequences of similar age in Thailand, we defend that the high Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios in Cretaceous seawater was the de facto cause for tachyhydrite deposition in both regions. Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios of global seawater were raised by hydrothermal activity over basalts produced at exceptionally high rates in the Aptian along new mid-oceanic ridges and in oceanic plateaus such as Ontong-Java. The heat loss caused by this exceptionally high igneous activity may have been instrumental to the change of the thermochemical conditions across the core-mantle boundary that stabilized the Cretaceous Normal Superchron for nearly 40 Ma, from 123.4 to 121.2 Ma (2σ) to 83.07 ± 0.15 Ma (2σ) Ma. Aptian volcanic activity in the South Atlantic formed the Rio Grande Rise - Walvis Ridge that was the southern barrier of the salt basin, lava flows on the São Paulo Plateau, and basalts along the developing South Atlantic Ridge. Evaporite facies reflect cyclic changes on all scales when concentrating the depositing brines. We therefore analyze the effect of increases in brine concentration on the formation of salt crystals throughout multiple depositional cycles. In the later stages of the Brazilian salt basins, increased inflow of seawater from the Central Atlantic Ocean along the Equatorial pull-apart rift basins enlarged and deepened the existent brine lake while its salinity, and especially its Ca and Mg contents, dropped. Flooding by this less concentrated brine created an unconformity, leaching Mg and Ca from the carnallite and tachyhydrite previously deposited, and replacing them with secondary sylvinite. Our results can be applied to the essentially uncored salt sequence of the Campos and Santos basins, where igneous and hydrothermal activity provided additional sources of calcium. The Ca excess may have been increased still further by serpentinization of lithospheric mantle beneath hyperextended crust and by percolation of seawater through mafic rocks of the proto-Rio Grande Rise – Walvis Ridge that formed the southern barrier of the salt basin.

A1168,"On July 16, 2000, a crude oil spill occurred at the PETROBRAS refinery Refinaria Presidente Getúlio Vargas-REPAR, located in Araucária, PR, Brazil A significant quantity of oil was retained within an area known as Ponto 0, between the spill site and Rio Barigüi, contaminating the banks of a small stream (Arroio Saldanha), the soil adjacent to the stream, and the soil of four small wetlands, over a distance of 2 km. This paper presents an overview of the remediation program for Ponto 0, and draws preliminary conclusions regarding the efficacy of different remediation technologies. The major remediation technologies are: 1) injection and recovery trenches for free-product recovery in the sector adjacent to the spill site; 2) in situ bioremediation along the floodplain of Arroio Saldanha; and 3) a treatment wetland near the discharge of Arroio Saldanha into Rio Barigüi. The trenches appear to have removed most of the free product from the sector adjacent to the spill site. There is preliminary evidence, based on soil monitoring data, for the efficacy of in situ bioremediation, but further data will be required before a firm conclusion can be drawn. The treatment wetland was successful in restoring wetland vegetation (an essential component of this technology), and appears to be capable of removing hydrocarbons from groundwater. Data of the groundwater monitoring program indicates a general decline in TPH concentrations, over the October 2000, August 2001 and April 2002 sampling campaigns.
