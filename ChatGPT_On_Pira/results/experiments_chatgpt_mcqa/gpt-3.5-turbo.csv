  C: The by-catch of seabirds and the depletion of their prey caused by fishing.
  D: These information and thematic maps can aid government agencies in delineating extractive and fishery exclusion areas, thus contributing to the management plan for this species.
  E: A variety of options exist to deal with critical levels of marine litter, some of which include approaches to address the issue, while understanding that not all are applicable to or supported by every country and some do not consider adverse impacts: the reduction of plastic consumption; support for eco-design and innovation (especially research into end-of-life plastic issues and alternatives); resource efficiency and better management of waste and water; long-term, efficient and viable recycling targets for municipal waste, packaging and plastic waste; greater use of policy instruments and control measures, including incentives, taxes and other regulatory measures, such as bans or extended producer responsibility schemes; and the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives and the coordination of policy investments in the waste sector. There is also a need for tight regulation and supervision of global waste trading, especially scrap plastic.

B2576,"What has fuelled the increase of eutrophication the world currently experiences?
 ","Answer the following question with the correct alternative. GIVE ONLY THE CORRECT LETTER. Question: What has fuelled the increase of eutrophication the world currently experiences?
  A: The increase on the anthropogenic inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems caused by the use of certain fertilizers, combustion of fossil fuels, cultivation of nitrogen fixing legumes and waste from both livestock production and urban areas.
  B: To guarantee the quality of coastal population life and the protection of ecosystems resources.
  C: The quality of coastal population life and the protection of ecosystems and resources within it.
  D: Eutrophication of coastal bays in the tropics can generate large stocks of planktonic biomass and detrital organic carbon which are permanently being produced and partially degraded and buried in sediments.
  E: Traditionally as goods, services and and cultural benefits.

B2585,"What factors can affect fish-communities properties in coastal areas?
 ","Answer the following question with the correct alternative. GIVE ONLY THE CORRECT LETTER. Question: What factors can affect fish-communities properties in coastal areas?
  A: Physical and chemical habitat features, depth, sediment types, benthic communities, contaminant levens, oxygen levels and disturbance of the sea floor.
  B: Many projections estimate the loss of all commercial fisheries by the middle of the century, but this information is unreliable.
  C: This is effective in improving fatigue and adopting a slow wave configuration, instead of a simple catenary. SLWRs have been used successfully in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Australia. However, it is probably the most computationally intensive aspect of it. Fatigue analysis requires a large number of load cases to be performed, in complex nonlinear models.
  D: A variety of options exist to deal with critical levels of marine litter, some of which include approaches to address the issue, while understanding that not all are applicable to or supported by every country and some do not consider adverse impacts: the reduction of plastic consumption; support for eco-design and innovation (especially research into end-of-life plastic issues and alternatives); resource efficiency and better management of waste and water; long-term, efficient and viable recycling targets for municipal waste, packaging and plastic waste; greater use of policy instruments and control measures, including incentives, taxes and other regulatory measures, such as bans or extended producer responsibility schemes; and the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives and the coordination of policy investments in the waste sector. There is also a need for tight regulation and supervision of global waste trading, especially scrap plastic.
  E: The extinction of herbivorous fish and excessive nutrients from sewage and agriculture
